ICE is an extension network and EVM-compatible application hub of the ICON ecosystem built with Substrate SDK. ICE aims to become a crowdloan-funded Polkadot parachain that serves as an extension network and application hub for the ICON ecosystem. ICE is the first network to use the Substrate SDK to extend the feature-set of an existing layer one blockchain.

ICE is optimized for ICON's BTP. This will position ICE as a potential flagship chain within the Polkadot ecosystem that showcases industry-leading cross-chain applications — all powered by ICON’s BTP. ICE is EVM and eWASM-compatible. Migrate your Ethereum dApp to ICE, and benefit from lower gas fees and ICE's network of connected blockchains.
