BTP, or Blockchain Transmission Protocol, is ICON's interoperability solution for cross-chain communication. BTP is chain-agnostic, which means it can be integrated with any smart contract-enabled blockchain, and does not require connected chains to be built with a common framework or SDK.

BTP is a trustless and decentralized bridging solution because it derives security from the source and destination blockchains instead of a trusted bridge operator. Lastly, BTP supports generic messaging between smart contracts, which means it can be used for a variety of complex use cases beyond basic token swaps.
