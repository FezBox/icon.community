Balanced is a DeFi platform that allows users to collateralize ICX and mint bnUSD up to a certain LTV ratio. Balanced also has a built-in AMM-style decentralized exchange where users can swap between supported assets. The Balanced protocol is owned and governed by a DAO comprised of Balance Token (BALN) holders.

Balanced is developed by a team of core contributors that includes ICX Station, Parrot9, Geometry Labs, and Mousebelt.
