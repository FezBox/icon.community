A DAO built on the ICON network, Omm is a money market where anyone can lend and borrow assets, earn interest, and own a share of the protocol. Omm has a direct fiat on- and off-ramp through the Bridge widget.

Suppliers and Borrowers can earn $OMM tokens as a reward for the liquidity provided to Omm. OMM holders are entitled to governance rights of the platform, delegation rights of the staking pool for ICX deposits, and usage of the Omm DAO fund.
