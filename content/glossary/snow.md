SNOW is the community-governed canary network to ICE. SNOW aims to become a community-oriented and crowdloan-funded Kusama parachain that serves as a canary network for ICE.

SNOW is a community-governed network – all ICZ token incentives go to airdrop recipients and crowdlenders, and there is no team allocation. SNOW is developed with Substrate – a development framework for high-performance blockchains that are native to the Kusama ecosystem. Substrate powers a number of top projects including Polkadot, Kusama, Chainlink, Moonbeam, and more.

SNOW is optimized for ICON's BTP. This will position SNOW as a potential flagship chain within the Kusama ecosystem that showcases industry-leading cross-chain applications — all powered by ICON’s BTP. SNOW is EVM and eWASM-compatible. Migrate your Ethereum dApp to SNOW, and benefit from lower gas fees and SNOW's network of connected blockchains.
