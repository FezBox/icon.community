SCORE (Smart Contract on Reliable Environment) is a smart contract running on ICON network. A smart contract is a collection of codes (functions) and data (states) that resides at a specific address on the blockchain. SCORE can be regarded as a state transition machine that a user could implement a service logic such as token transfers. The state transition is triggered by sending transactions to an address that the SCORE resides. Any service logic that can be modeled by a state transition machine can be implemented in the SCORE code.

A unique aspect of ICON SCORE is that its programming language is Java, a general purpose programming language, it is easy to learn and already popular nowadays. So if you are already familiar with Java language, you can write SCORE code right away without needing to learn a new programming language.
