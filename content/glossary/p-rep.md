The ICON blockchain is governed by Public Representatives (P-Reps). To become a P-Rep, a team or individual must go through an on-chain registration process which includes paying a 2,000 ICX registration fee. Following registration, a P-Rep can start receiving delegation in the form of staked ICX.

ICX holders can stake and delegate ICX to P-Reps – entities that have registered to participate in governing the ICON blockchain. This DPoS implementation offers the best of both worlds – stakers can passively earn rewards, while technical individuals that are actually interested in setting up infrastructure and governing ICON can do so.
