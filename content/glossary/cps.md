The CPS, short for "Contribution Proposal System", is a decentralized grant program operated by a subset of ICON P-Reps. The CPS is open for anyone looking to receive funding for an ICON-related project, and doesn't require KYC procedures. For payouts, the CPS uses bnUSD, which means applicants are shielded from market volatility.
