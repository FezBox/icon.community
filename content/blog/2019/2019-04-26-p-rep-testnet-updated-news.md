### **P-Rep TestNet UpdatedÂ News**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ATbypMEncpwtnoubnhL9fw.png)Greetings from the ICON Team,

Following on our recent notice on the [opening of P-Rep TestNet Application](https://medium.com/helloiconworld/p-rep-testnet-application-open-97e3f7ad1e6d), we are happy to present the [P-Rep Installation and Configuration Guide](https://www.icondev.io/docs/p-rep-installation-and-configuration) and announce the detailed schedule as follows.

The TestNet operation period will last **from April 30th to June 17th** which will be split into two phases. Each phase can be consisted of several TestNets run by 22 P-Rep nodes. If the number of P-Rep nodes exceeds 22 in a TestNet, a separate TestNet will open. Please note that **the application deadline has been extended from April 26th to April 30th** in order to adjust requests we received.
