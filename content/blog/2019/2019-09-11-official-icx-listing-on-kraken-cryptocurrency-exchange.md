Hello ICONists,

We are very excited to announce that starting September 12th, you can purchase and trade ICX, the native token for the ICON network, on [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/en-us/), a leading U.S. based cryptocurrency exchange. Trading pairs include ICX/USD, ICX/EUR, ICX/XBT, and ICX/ETH. This is the first time that our community will be able to purchase and trade ICX with the U.S. Dollar and the Euro.

“Many people know ICON as the top Korean blockchain project, and so, we are proud to lead the way by being the first Korean project to be listed on a U.S. based exchange,” said Min Kim, ICON Foundation council member. “Moreover, we believe this is evidence that industry leaders like Kraken now recognize that ICON is rapidly evolving into a global project with a truly decentralized global community.”

The ICON project has garnered strong support from the region. Approximately 22 percent, or 17 of 77, of the [pre-registered P-Rep candidates](https://icon.community/iconsensus/candidates/) are located in the U.S. This listing will further help accelerate the growth of the ICON community and ecosystem.

On August 13, 2019, the ICON Foundation announced the [Pre-voting period and 3 million ICX giveaway event](https://medium.com/helloiconworld/iconsensus-announcing-p-rep-pre-voting-866a4b89c60) to incentivize early voters to participate in ICON governance. **ICX token holders can stake ICX to earn block rewards today.** This month, the ICON network is having its first on-chain election called [ICONSENSUS](https://icon.community/iconsensus/) where 22 public representatives (‘P-Reps’) will be voted in by the community.
