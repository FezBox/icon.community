## **Announcing — ICONSENSUS Ambassadors**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*bXrGv-zXCSx77N66)Greetings from the ICON Team,

We are pleased to announce the result of the **ICONSENSUS Campaign Ambassador Recruitment Program.** We would like to thank all community members for their interest in the Ambassador Program. After careful consideration of each candidate’s participation activities, proposals and qualifications, we have selected 10 Ambassadors.

The ICON Team will reach out to [selected Ambassador candidates](http://bit.ly/2DY66Mk) starting today.

**Spreading the ICONSENSUS Campaign Together**

We believe that ICONSENSUS Campaign Ambassadors will play a key role as campaign advocates at the heart of our community. We are looking forward to collaborating with ambassadors to promote the upcoming P-Rep elections with creative content.

The campaign we create, the visions of hyperconnecting the world we strive for, the ecosystem we build — It’s all about ICONists coming to consensus together. We would like to once again thank all the applicants and ambassadors for joining our ICONSENSUS journey.
