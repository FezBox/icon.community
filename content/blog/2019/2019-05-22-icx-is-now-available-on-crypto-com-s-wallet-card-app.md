## **ICX is now available on Crypto.com’s Wallet & Card App**

### Spend ICX at over 40m merchants globally

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*rugon0PqGoJsLtzoMv_uKA.jpeg)As of today, ICX, the native token for the ICON network, will be available on [Crypto.com](https://www.crypto.com/)’s pioneering wallet and card app for Android and iOS. With this listing, ICONists will be able to bridge between fiat and ICX along with other cryptocurrencies in one easy to use application. By adding ICX to the Crypto.com Wallet & Card App, users can now buy ICX **at true cost with no fees** at Crypto.com — **credit card and bank transfer both supported**.

Crypto.com also offers the MCO Visa Card which adds additional utility to ICX as users can easily convert cryptocurrencies into fiat currencies and spend at over 40m merchants globally. Now, ICONists can actually spend/use ICX in normal everyday commerce furthering our goal of mainstream adoption!

“We strongly identify with ICON’s mission to bridge gaps within the blockchain ecosystem. Crypto.com is keen to add value to their mission and accelerate the world’s transition to blockchain and cryptocurrency.” **Kris Marszalek, Co-Founder and CEO of Crypto.com**

“Crypto.com’s Wallet & Card App will offer the ICON community increased efficiency and enhanced security in trading and converting crypto assets. The ICON Foundation will continue securing diverse and strong partnerships to allow for our community to manage and use ICX conveniently.” **Min Kim, Council Member of the ICON Foundation**

We are proud to partner with Crypto.com and will continue to look for ways to collaborate in the future.
