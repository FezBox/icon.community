### ICONSENSUS: “P-Rep Candidate Conference Call” to be live streamed!

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*oJpJhlLWdTip6-Dc)Greetings from ICON Team,

We proudly present the opening of **“ICONSENSUS P-Rep Candidate Conference Call”**, a live stream powered by the icon.community from May 28th to 31st. During the conference call, P-Rep candidates will introduce themselves to the ICONists and discuss their proposals and how they will contribute to the ICON Network. This is a great opportunity for all ICONists to see the candidates and gain further insight prior to the actual upcoming on-chain election in September.
