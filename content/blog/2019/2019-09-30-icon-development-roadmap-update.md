## ICON Development Roadmap Update

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xX2gwjC4To9HhWyqTUwTEg.png)September 2019

Hello from ICON Foundation,

It has been another busy month as we prepare for the decentralization of the ICON network. We continue to accomplish so much as we seek to deliver a stabilized, innovative and intuitive DPoS network. As we move into the last month ahead of launch, we look forward to sharing additional details along the way.

**IISS Updates**

This month, the Foundation decided to extend the testing period for decentralization as core developers of the ICON Project continue to test software in a variety of ways to reach higher levels of stabilization. As a result, the decentralization schedule of the ICON Network was changed from September 24, 2019 to October 29, 2019. As previously announced, the Foundation will maintain reward distributions until decentralization.

Additionally, the Foundation delayed the implementation of the Slashing function, a penalty burning 6% of the delegated ICX of representatives, to one month post decentralization. This decision was made to allow for a one-month buffer period for P-Reps to gain experience operating in the early stages of decentralization.

**Mobile Staking Update**

We plan to launch mobile staking capabilities in tandem with decentralization in October. Originally, our goal was to launch mobile staking capabilities in September, but we encountered several Java version issues in the development process. Unfortunately, the development schedule was too tight to resolve the issues and therefore we decided to postpone the release to improve the stability.

While we understand these updates may be disappointing to some ICONists in our community, we are trying to ensure a smooth and successful launch of the network and ask for your patience and understanding.

**ICON Development Roadmap Details**

We’re pleased to share the following updates to our technology roadmap below:

* **Block Version 0.3** — Improving block structure to support BTP (Stabilization)
* **Role Switch** — Switching the role between Main P-Rep and Sub P-Rep (Stabilization)
* **Cryptography** — Signature verifying function in SCORE (Completed)
* **Penalty function** — Penalty system to penalize malicious P-Reps (Completed)
* **Virtual Step 2.1** — Virtual Step distribution to SCORE (Development)
* **Auto Sign** — Ability to automatically sign transactions in ICONex, for a certain period of time (Completed)

Please note: The current roadmap was designed at the end of 2018 and will be updated to better reflect our initiatives in this dynamic blockchain industry. Thank you for your patience.

Thank you,

ICON Foundation
