### **ICON Accelerates its Expansion of its Public Blockchain Ecosystem**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*h9BG31gwGGBR4QJw)Greetings from the ICON Team,

January 18th, 2019 — The ICON Team accelerates our strategy to expand the ICON public blockchain ecosystem. Along with [the start of the P-Rep pre-registration for ICON P-Rep candidacy](https://bit.ly/2CvGuVi), the ICON Team would like to announce our effort to enhance our corporate blockchain alliance program and global accelerator program, as well as our plans to release a decentralized exchange (DEX) and decentralized identification (DID) system based on the ICON public network in the first half of this year.

#### **■ Reinforcing enterprise blockchain alliance with global DApp accelerator program**

ICON pursues DApp partners focused on both B2C and B2B products through the newly established ICON LAP100 (ICON Loopchain Alliance Program) and our global accelerator program, ICX Station. ICON has currently formed partnerships with more than 30 companies to carry out collaboration projects, and already secured 13 new partners this year.

ICON is the only blockchain project in South Korea to run a global accelerator program through launching ICX Station locations in major cities such as San Francisco, Singapore, and Seoul. Deblock is serving as the Seoul launchpad of ICX Station, playing a pivotal role in advancing South Korea’s DApp projects into the global market. ICON also has plans to launch a Tokyo launchpad in the first half of this year.

In addition to existing partners in various fields, ‘AC3’, a US-based customer-driven viral marketing platform, ‘VELIC’, a Singapore-based comprehensive finance platform for crypto-assets, and ‘Somesing’, a social music application combining user-generated content and reward system joined as ICON’s new DApp partners this year. ICON is currently in conversations with more potential DApp partners as the mission to grow the ecosystem continues.

In addition to the efforts of ICX Station, ICON has recently established ‘ICON LAP100’, which is an enterprise blockchain alliance program based on the ICON public blockchain (the core blockchain engine of ICON is loopchain). Its goal is to jointly develop enterprise-specialized blockchain solutions with 100 companies and startups in various fields including biometric identification, certification issuance, payment, etc. On December 27th 2018, ICON held a launch event with several members of ICON LAP100 including Raonsecure, Digitalzone, DataAlliance, Matrix2B, OWDIN Network, Charzin, TheVita, Liwonace, Cryptofuture, and TeamK. Discussions are underway for business development and technology support.

#### **■ Decentralized exchange and identification service to be released in the first half of this year**

ICON announces plans to release its decentralized exchange (DEX) and decentralized identification (DID) in the first half of this year. ICON has already released [ICONex](https://icon.foundation/contents/icx/iconex?lang=en), the wallet that supports transactions across multiple cryptocurrencies with a user-friendly UX/UI, and [ICON Tracker](https://tracker.icon.foundation/), which is a block explorer for ICON that displays all transaction records on the network to enhance transparency and data accessibility.

Decentralized exchange (DEX) will support p2p exchange between ICX and IRC2 (ICON mainnet-based tokens). All transactions will be executed via smart contracts to ensure security and transparency compared to centralized exchanges. Additionally, ICON’s DEX will increase the liquidity and usability of IRC2 tokens in the ICON Network, without being listed on external exchanges. ICON aims to implement DEX to connect heterogeneous blockchains in the future and bridge various blockchain communities.

ICON plans to release a decentralized identification (DID) mobile application based on its public blockchain. ICON’s DID aligns with the increasing need for data sovereignty, and will allow individuals to store and manage their personal information themselves compared to the current centralized identification system. The benefits of DID include falsification protection, duplication protection, and security of information. DID supports user identification for DApps, making it unnecessary to establish a separate ID system within each individual DApp. The ICON Team will strive to accelerate the expansion of the ICON ecosystem, so join our journey to hyperconnect the world.

Thank you,

Vote, Spread, Disrupt  
ICON Team
