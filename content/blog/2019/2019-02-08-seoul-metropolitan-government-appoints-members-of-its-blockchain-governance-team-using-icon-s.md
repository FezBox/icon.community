### **Seoul Metropolitan Government appoints members of its ‘Blockchain Governance Team’ Using ICON’s Public Blockchain**

**Supports issuance and browsing through mobile phones, preventing falsification and fake issuance by recording history on the blockchain**

The Seoul Metropolitan Government issued mobile letters of appointment to its [Blockchain Governance Team](http://opengov.seoul.go.kr/sanction/16900520) using ICON’s public blockchain. Government and supporting agencies are expected to take the first step in leveraging both public and private blockchain systems.

ICONLOOP developed mobile letters of appointment for the Seoul Blockchain Governance Team. The letter can be issued and viewed through a Governance Team member’s personal cell phone. A Governance Team member can issue a letter of appointment with a name, member identification number and membership terms after accepting the terms and conditions. Letter of appointment issuance records are **stored on the ICON public blockchain**, making falsification and fake issuance impossible. Authenticity of the record can be verified in the [ICON Tracker](https://tracker.icon.foundation/) by searching for a specific transaction.

According to ‘Plans for Blockchain City Seoul’ announced last October, Seoul Metropolitan Government has organized the ‘[Seoul Blockchain Governance Team](http://opengov.seoul.go.kr/sanction/16900520),’ aiming to provide blockchain administration services across several industries.

The Seoul Blockchain Governance Team consists of 100 citizens comprised of college students, developers, corporate representatives, and more. The team plans to participate in a pilot operation of blockchain-based administration services, and provide feedback and recommendations from January 2019 through December 2020. Additionally, they will participate in the development process of Seoul Metropolitan City’s administration services, which include mileage points integration, citizenship card services, online authentication without documents, protection for part-time workers’ rights, and sub-contract payments.

“We expect the increase in public blockchain use-cases led by government, and this appointment letter issuance is a starting point to show a clear example of how blockchain can be used in government” said J.H. Kim, council member of the ICON Foundation and CEO of ICONLOOP. Kim added, “ICONLOOP will focus on improving development capability to provide transparent and efficient blockchain-based administration services, cooperating with Seoul Metropolitan Government.”

ICONLOOP was selected as an operator of Seoul’s standard blockchain platform for the ‘[Seoul Blockchain Demonstration Project](https://medium.com/helloiconworld/iconloop-selected-to-demonstrate-seoul-blockchain-platform-42b7701529)’ and the ‘[Seoul blockchain-based ISP (Information Strategy Planning) Project](https://medium.com/helloiconworld/iconloop-to-participate-in-seoul-blockchain-based-isp-information-strategy-planning-project-cb635d1c56a5),’ which is commissioned by the [Seoul Metropolitan Government](http://english.seoul.go.kr/). ICONLOOP has been applying loopchain, ICONLOOP’s proprietary blockchain engine, to the Seoul Blockchain Standard Platform, used car trading system, and mobile-voting system. Additionally, ICONLOOP has provided other individual verification services such as the citizen card, mileage points integration, subcontract payment, and others. ICONLOOP, as the sole operator, has analyzed blockchain-based unit activities and informatization status, and established a multi-phase plan for ISP.

The ICON Team will continue to deliver the value of the public blockchain and realize it to practical use-cases.

Thank you,
