## ICONSENSUS: Announcing P-Rep Pre-Voting

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*RNehMHxJyMzFAQo79DNnOw.png)Greetings ICONists,

The ICON Ecosystem has witnessed the community-driven movement and international participation as we approach a monumental moment of decentralizing the ICON Network. Prior to the on-chain election, the ICON is pleased to announce **the P-Rep Pre-Voting event from August 26th to September 24t**h **for 30 days**, allowing ICONists and P-Rep candidates to experience and understand the voting process to delegate their stake to the right candidate to become a public representative.

During the Pre-Voting Period, ICON will be giving away up to 3 million ICX as a reward for early adopters of staking and voting. The P-Rep candidates can register on-chain and start accumulating delegated stakes, while all the participating ICX holders will receive the voting reward. Anybody holding ICX during the Pre-Voting Period has the opportunity to stake and delegate their tokens to earn their share of the giveaway.

### **1. Pre-Voting Period**

* Begin: Block height: 7,560,000 (2019 August 26th UTC 05:00)
* End: Block height: 8,856,000 (2019 September 24th UTC 05:00)

### **2. Guidelines for ICONists**

* ICONists will be able to vote directly through their ICONex wallet via an updated UI/UX to support staking and delegation.
* ICONists who participated in the Pre-Voting are eligible to receive a voting reward calculated every day, which will be distributed from a total of approximately 3 million ICX reward pool.
* How to Participate: Check out the ICONex Wallet Tutorial on [the Pre-Voting event page](https://icon.community/iconsensus/prevoting/)

### **3. Guidelines for P-Rep Candidates**

* Any individual or team who wishes to be a P-Rep candidate during the Pre-Voting period can pre-register as a P-Rep candidate on the ICON Network on-chain.
* **On-chain registration will require a 2,000 ICX registration fee, which will be burned effective immediately.**
* Delegated stakes through Pre-Voting will be accumulated until the on-chain elections in September. The P-Rep rewards, including delegation reward and the block production reward, will be available only after the implementation of decentralization and the election of P-Rep candidates. Please note that during the Pre-Voting, there will be no representative reward as P-Rep candidates will not produce nor verify any blocks as P-Reps.
* Early Registration is highly recommended.P-Rep candidates can register when the block height is 7,560,000.
* ICON Network decentralization will be activated at the block height of 8,856,000 assuming all of the top 22 P-Rep candidates have received at least 1,600,920 ICX in delegation.
* How to Participate: Check out the [Pre-Voting Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Lqd-2FA6Tvc4YaYnzkSXbCwC-ILLq8KmmknGTvcZXk0/edit?usp=sharing) for P-Rep candidates for how to install nodes and related documents

The purpose of the Pre-Voting period is two folds. Firstly, in the spirit of decentralization, ICON will be giving away 3 million ICX to further dilute ICON’s percentage ownership of the network and give more power to individual ICONists that participate in this early adopter program. **During the Pre-Voting Period, ICON will be diluting itself in order to give more power to the individual ICONist.**

Secondly, this is an opportunity to stabilize the network prior to launch by allowing votes to balance out between all P-Rep candidates. **ICONists are strongly encouraged to spread their delegation across multiple P-Reps to prevent the centralization of power.**

The ICON Foundation is excited to see how close we are to achieving a decentralized network and look forward to seeing how ICONists vote.

Thank you.

Vote, Spread, Disrupt
