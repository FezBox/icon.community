## **ICON’s Got Talent Final Award**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*jKgSoAACu-deGjfk)Greetings ICONists,

ICON TX Challenge + ICON’s Got Talent has finally come to an end after 2 months of exciting progress from the community!

ICON TX Challenge officially began on June 3rd, and it has successfully **generated 60M+ transactions in merely 24 days**, which was very effective in stress testing the ICON Network and proving the performance of the network before the decentralization. Additionally, ICON’s Got Talent has successfully brought [**20 meaningful blockchain-based services**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LiHWJynLsO6ldGSJ7pKXp-bBIDYDaH8nWmzNG0wX2dc/edit#gid=0) on the ICON Network and the community was very excited to see meaningful developments on the network.

Of 20 participating teams, 6 finals winners were selected by [**10 esteemed judges**](https://medium.com/helloiconworld/icon-tx-challenge-icons-got-talent-3d534d1cfea8), who include individuals from the ICON team, accelerators, and crypto funds. Judges scored every project carefully and it was very hard for them to make the decision because it was a close competition. For participating teams that didn’t win, please don’t be disappointed as many judges were still impressed with a number of services that didn’t make it to the final winners. The scoring process involved taking out the maximum score and the minimum score among 10 judges to reduce the bias for each project and averaging out the rest of the 8 judges’ scores for each project.

We are very excited to announce the following 6 winners, who will be receiving 50,000 ICX.
