## #8. ICON Development Roadmap Update — August 2019

Hello from ICON Foundation,

It is the end of the month, and we’re excited to announce the development updates for August. We’ve accomplished so much as we move closer to decentralization and we look forward to sharing additional details along the way.

**ICONex Chrome Extension Update**

To accommodate the [Pre-voting and 3 million ICX Giveaway promotion event](https://medium.com/helloiconworld/pre-voting-is-here-6fa804a12559) launched earlier this week, we updated the [ICONex Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/iconex/flpiciilemghbmfalicajoolhkkenfel?hl=en) to version 1.0.4.0. Please make sure you update to this latest version, and also, make sure you backup your Keystore file or Private key prior to the update, just to be safe.

With ICONEx, you can directly participate in the governance of the network by staking and voting with your ICX. The Pre-voting period will last for 30 days from August 26 — September 24, 2019. The election will begin right after. Currently, we have 42 P-rep candidates registered on-chain and over 70 registered at icon.community.

**ICON Tracker Update**

Our [ICON Tracker](https://tracker.icon.foundation/) has also been updated to make it easier to follow all the action on the governance of the ICON network. The new [governance page](https://tracker.icon.foundation/governance) has a lot of good information and it changes often, so be sure to refresh the page every now and then.

**IISS Updates**

And, of course, in order for 3 million ICX Giveaway promotion event to happen, the Incentive Distribution Function for P-Rep and Voters had to be completed. ICON is unique in that the network rewards active contribution (i.e. staking and voting).

**Contribution Proposal Paper**

Additionally, this week, ICON released the framework that outlines the process to begin earning rewards from the DApp Booster Program and Ecosystem Expansion Project initiatives. Upon implementation of this system, ICONists will be able to directly control the distribution of funds generated by the ICON Network via voting on [Ecosystem Expansion Projects](https://helloiconworld.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/35000105757-ecosystem-expansion-project-eep-) and DApps to add to the [DApp Booster Program](https://helloiconworld.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/35000105758-dapp-booster-program-dbp-) (DBP). This framework is designed to turn the ICON Republic into one of the first fully functioning decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).

The month of August was primarily focused on decentralization of the ICON network. The “[ICONSENSUS, the Journey Toward Mass Adoption](https://medium.com/helloiconworld/iconsensus-the-journey-toward-mass-adoption-3fbc7dd44541)” will conclude in September and you will witness P-Reps from all over the world partaking in governance of the ICON Republic. Together, we will make history.

Thank you,

ICON Foundation
