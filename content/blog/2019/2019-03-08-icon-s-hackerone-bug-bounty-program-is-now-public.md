### ICON’s HackerOne Bug Bounty Program is Now Public

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*YDJ5Ez6w2oGXz63BcqJR2Q.png)Greetings from the ICON Team,

The ICON Foundation is pleased to announce that the [**ICON-HackerOne Bounty Program**](https://medium.com/@helloiconworld/icon-foundation-runs-bug-bounty-program-556e72979297) is now **PUBLIC**. This allows anyone interested in the ICON Project to participate in the bug bounty program. The ICON Foundation has been running the private bounty program with [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/), a global cybersecurity company with outstanding bug bounty practices across diverse industries, since November 2018. By opening this to the public, the ICON Foundation will accelerate the stability and security of the ICON Network.

Along with this change, the ICON Foundation is launching a **promotional incentive program** for all who participate in the public bounty program starting in March. If you report 2 valid issues, 2x of the original bounty will be provided as promotional incentives. For the next 3 valid reports after 2x incentives, you can also receive 1.5x of the original bounty. For more information on participation in the public bounty program and the incentive promotion, please visit the [ICON page within the HackerOne website](https://hackerone.com/iconloop_inc).  
* This promotional incentive program is limited to participation in the public program starting March 2019.

The ICON Foundation continues to act quickly in responding to the potential security threats discovered through the bug bounty program and apply security patches. To date, fourteen issues have been reported and are in the process of being fixed. The ICON Foundation hopes to be able to build a secure blockchain network with more white-hat hackers and developers by switching the program to the public.

The ICON Foundation will continue to make efforts to improve security, as this should be a top priority of any blockchain network. **We look forward to your participation and interest.**

Thank you,

Hyperconnect the World  
ICON Team
