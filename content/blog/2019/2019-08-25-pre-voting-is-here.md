## Pre-Voting is Here!

Join in to Participate in the 3 Million ICX Reward Pool

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*IuJwJQKJYNB351iydFgmUA.png)Greetings ICONists,

We are pleased to officially announce the start of the P-Rep Pre-Voting event which will last until September 24th (for 30 days), allowing ICONists and P-Rep candidates to experience and understand the staking and voting processes.

As a reminder, first and foremost, Pre-Voting is an opportunity to stabilize the network prior to launch by allowing votes to balance out among P-Rep candidates. As part of this process, ICONists are strongly encouraged to spread their delegation across multiple P-Reps to prevent any centralization of power.

The ICON Foundation is excited about the progress we’ve made thus far and how close we are to achieving a decentralized network and look forward to seeing how ICONists vote.

**Pre-Voting Period**

Note, this may be subject to minor changes.

Start: Tentative block height: 7,601,158 (2019 August 26th UTC 05:00).

End: Tentative block height: 8,897,158 (2019 September 24th UTC 05:00)

**ICONex update**

ICONists will be able to stake and delegate directly through their ICONex wallet via our *newly* updated UI/UX.

* During the Pre-Voting period, **ICONists will need to utilize the web version**.
* An updated version of ICONex will be available at the Chrome Webstore starting at UTC 02:00 on August 26th.
* For a tutorial, please refer to the ICONex Wallet Tutorial on the [Pre-Voting event page](https://icon.community/iconsensus/prevoting/).
* Mobile capabilities will be made available on September 24th.

**ICON Tracker update**

ICON will also be releasing an updated ICON Tracker (at UTC 3:00 on August 26th) which will include a new governance section and an improved UI/UX.

* With this update, ICONists will be able to easily track staked ICX, voted ICX, governance variables, P-Rep rankings, and productivity.

**P-Rep Candidates**

Lastly, we strongly recommend all P-Reps candidates to join the official P-Rep Telegram channel. All detailed information including procedural and technical support throughout the pre-voting registration and decentralization process will be provided exclusively in this channel. Please join by following the link here: <https://t.me/joinchat/IICI6lRuvnHL7tUUapfG1w>

Thank you.

Vote, Spread, Disrupt
