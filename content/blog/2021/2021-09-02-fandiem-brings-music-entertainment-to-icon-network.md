## Fandiem Brings Music & Entertainment to ICON Network

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*-ElVdGRwiz6DX3LYYsxASg.jpeg)The 1.3 million-dollar sale of a [rock](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/08/24/etherrock-nft-sells-for-1-point-3-million-sale-prices-jump-in-week.html), [Paris Hilton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiN1_6pb_eE) schooling Jimmy Fallon, and [VISA](https://hypebeast.com/2021/8/visa-enters-nfts-cryptopunk-7610-acquisition-interview) adding CryptoPunks to its art collection are just a few headlines that are signaling that the NFT space is heating up. Amidst the NFT craze, we are excited to announce a new partnership with [Fandiem](http://winwith.fandiem.com/press-release-icon), an innovative non-profit fundraising platform for fans, to help grow ICON’s NFT ecosystem.

With the new partnership, we are looking forward to expanding ICON’s NFT marketplace by attracting high-quality content from famous musical artists and bands, world-renowned music festivals, athletes, and creators working closely with Fandiem. With deep connections in the music and entertainment industry and a keen eye for innovation, Fandiem has created a unique platform that connects fans to their favorite celebrities for the chance to win once-in-a-lifetime experiences in the real world while at the same time raising money for various philanthropic initiatives. Fandiem is a project of The Giving Back Fund, a national 501c3 organization that encourages and facilitates charitable giving.

Committed to building communities around charitable giving, Fandiem has built its platform around a sweepstakes model that gives everybody a chance to participate and benefit from charitable giving as opposed to an auction model in which only the highest bidder wins. Through the “donate-to-win” model pioneered by the team, Fandiem allows everybody to donate a small amount for a chance to win a personal experience with their favorite music and entertainment heroes.

Their unique offerings have attracted big names in the industry, including the Foo Fighters, Incubus, Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival, Governors Ball Festival, the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, Bobby Weir from The Grateful Dead, the NFL Alumni Association, and many more. With the new partnership with ICON, Fandiem seeks to leverage ICON’s blockchain technology and proprietary [Bridge](https://bridgepay.money/) wallet to expand its market reach to support a wider range of philanthropic initiatives for a greater number of partners and fans.

At ICON, we expect Fandiem to bring valuable NFTs to the ICON Network which will ultimately lead to the growth and adoption of our technology. Fandiem will be expanding its reward offering to include NFTs, which would include both traditional art and collection NFTs as well as NFTs for specific experiences with artists, celebrities and athletes. Select participants in sweepstakes will also get a unique digital collectible for their participation, which will augment the curation of NFTs currently available on the Craft network.

With Fandiem’s relationships and experience in the nonprofit sector, ICON’s base-layer technology, Craft’s NFT framework, and a growing market for NFTs, this strategic investment will help bring our mutual vision of building and promoting a marketplace and NFT issuance platform comparable to NBA Top Shot to the ICON Network.

### **About Fandiem:**

Fandiem is a contest fundraising platform that harnesses the power of the fan community to do good in the world. With their donation to a selected nonprofit, fans are entered to win once-in-a-lifetime experiences with their favorite artists, festivals, athletes, and creators. These are the opportunities that were previously available only to a select few but through Fandiem are awarded to the everyday fan at the heart of the community.

The Fandiem Foundation is a project of The Giving Back Fund, a national 501c3 organization that encourages and facilitates charitable giving. The Giving Back Fund grants donation proceeds to each campaign’s partner nonprofit.
