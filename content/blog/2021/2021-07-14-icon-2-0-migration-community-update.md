### ICON 2.0 Migration — Community Update

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ACaP2uFftohEr8O7TDF_vA.png)Development Progress, Timeline, and Path Forward

Greetings ICONists,

The ICON 2.0 MainNet launch is getting closer by the day. With the launch approaching, many in the community have asked for an update. We are happy to provide you with the latest progress and estimated timeline for the launch here.

Block migration is moving forward, albeit at a slower than anticipated pace. As of July 12th, we currently have around ~14M imported blocks (or 38% of the total). The reason this takes a long time is that 1) all transactions have to be re-executed one by one from the genesis block using the new goloop engine, 2) some features from the old node were missing and had to be re-added in goloop for backward compatibility which has added some additional delay and 3) goloop is written from scratch, with a different programming language, making it difficult to reproduce the same behavior from the previous node implementation. But our engineers are working hard every day to solve those very challenging issues.

As of right now, we estimate that this process can be completed by the end of August. But this timeline largely depends on how many incompatibility issues arise and how hard they are to solve. It could be earlier or later than the end of August. We will keep the community updated as we progress.

After block import completion, we estimate that it will take around two weeks to prepare nodes and exchanges for the hard fork. At that point, ICON 1.0 will be stopped simultaneously at a predefined block height by a network proposal which will then mark the start of the ICON 2.0 era.

Engineers are still discussing the MainNet launch plan details. What we know as of today is that we will have multiple releases and network proposals in a short amount of time to activate all of the ICON 2.0 features. We believe this will allow for a safer network transition while ensuring its stability. The main priority will be to enable the features needed for BTP contracts to be deployed as soon as possible.

We are also working on updating all the necessary tools around ICON 2.0, including but not limited to wallets, blockchain tracker, exchanges, development tools, and documentation. Lastly, we are also discussing the future of Python SCORE. **Please note that if you are planning to start developing an application on ICON 2.0, we highly recommend you write it in Java.**

We will keep you updated on our progress in the coming weeks. If you want to participate in this challenge, join our Telegram groups and share your thoughts with the community. Developers are welcome to participate as well.

Thank you,

ICON
