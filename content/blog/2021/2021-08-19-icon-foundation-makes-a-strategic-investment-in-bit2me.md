ICON Foundation is pleased to announce a strategic investment in Bit2Me, a leading blockchain platform in Europe with a fast-growing consumer base across its suite of financial products and services.

Bit2Me was founded in 2014 by Andrei Manuel and Leif Ferreira, who before Bit2Me had already established themselves as leaders in the European crypto scene by introducing Bitcoin ATMs and building on-ramping services such as Bitphone. Andrei and Leif have since grown the Bit2Me platform from a brokerage and blockchain academy to one that now hosts over 20 different financial tools and services that increase crypto accessibility to European users.

Through the partnership, ICON Foundation looks forward to expanding its technology, users, and brand in Europe, which remains a relatively untapped market for ICON. “We are now ready to push ICON more aggressively in Europe. Bit2Me is uniquely positioned to help ICON reach more users in Europe, but also globally,” said Min Kim, ICON Foundation Council Member. In addition to the 200K+ wallet users, Bit2Me also boasts an alumni network of 1.7 million — half of whom are Latin American — through [Bit2Me Academy](https://academy.bit2me.com/cursos/), which offers industry-recognized blockchain certification programs.

Having successfully concluded the Bit2Me (B2M) token private sale [raising 2.5 million euros](https://www.europapress.es/economia/finanzas-00340/noticia-bit2me-levanta-25-millones-euros-ronda-semilla-destinara-lanzar-token-20210802105931.html), Bit2Me will make the B2M token [available to the public](http://bit2me.com/token) through three rounds of public sales. “Over the years, the Bit2Me team has built a solid user base in Southern Europe for our crypto adoption tools by building out a wide range of easy-to-use crypto solutions. We are also very proud to have educated over a million alumni from Southern Europe and Latin America through original content and courses in our crypto Academy. The B2M token sale will help scale our operations further globally, allowing us to expand our services to users in the rest of the EU, Africa, and Latin America, and we are happy to have ICON be a part of this journey” said Leif Fereira, CEO of Bit2me.

The 1st public sale will take place from September 6th to September 13th, the 2nd from September 14th to September 21st, and finally the 3rd from September 22nd to September 30th. All citizens from countries that allow ICO participation are eligible.
