## ICON Launches a Dedicated Audit Fund

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*ecIHnJEE-h7PXZkA)Supporting Secure Development for ICON’s Growing Ecosystem

Dear ICONists,

We are excited to announce that we will be committing 500,000 ICX to cover smart contract audits for approved projects within the ICON Ecosystem. There have been countless smart contract vulnerabilities exploited in other blockchain ecosystems, and this fund represents a commitment by the ICON Foundation to foster an atmosphere of both security and innovation. We want to ensure that innovation is not stifled and security is not sacrificed because of costly smart contract audits.

In order to apply for a grant from this fund, please submit your project on the [forum](https://forum.icon.community/c/g/smart-contract-audit-request/46). This fund is for projects that are near completion, not in the ideation stage. Applications should include the following information:

* Link to your website
* Link to your white paper
* Link to your github
* Audit firm of choice
* A copy of the audit contract with estimate
* Contact information for your team

After submitting on the forum, the ICON team will review the request and contact you for next steps. We look forward to seeing more and more projects build on top of the upcoming DeFi infrastructure, and we are happy to support the smart contract audits of such projects.

Thank you,

ICON
