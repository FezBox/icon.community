Greetings ICONists,

We are excited to announce a new strategic partner to explore tokenization capabilities and innovation in the security token industry. The emergence of tokenization is transforming the financial industry. New digital securities, also known as security tokens, based on blockchain technology will unlock trillions of dollars in currently illiquid assets. Therefore scalable technological frameworks are of vital importance for these new digital securities.

### Benefits of this partnership include:

* exchange of knowledge and sharing of insights on security token infrastructure, compliance solutions, and regulation technology.
* working closely together to develop new standards for tokenized assets and how it could interconnect with other blockchains participating in the ICON network.
* sharing of operational infrastructure in Liechtenstein and South Korea.

“We continue to expand our partnership ecosystem to add more value for our customers,” said Monty C. M. Metzger, CEO, and Founder of LCX. “Partnering with ICON Foundation allows us to deliver more innovative solutions in the long-run, starting with security token standards and cross-blockchain payment capabilities,” said Monty C. M. Metzger, CEO, and Founder of LCX.

“I remember meeting Monty and the LCX team in Liechtenstein in December 2018. We’re impressed with the progress that they’ve made in the security token space, and we’re excited to explore opportunities for ICON,” said Min Kim, Co-Founder and Council Member of the ICON Foundation. “We are proud to partner with LCX to exchange knowledge and expertise to enable international growth of digital assets.”
