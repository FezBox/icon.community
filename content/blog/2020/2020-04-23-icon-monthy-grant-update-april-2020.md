Messari’s Registry aims to be a single source of truth for basic cryptoasset information. Participating projects voluntarily disclose basic information about their token design, supply details, technology audits, official communication channels, and relevant team members, investors, and advisors.

The Registry is the first open disclosures platform that allows projects to quickly and reliably communicate material updates to their communities and external stakeholders through a single, standardized interface. Messari validates project data and provides free access to disclosures via an open API that allows third-party services to rally around one universal cryptoasset disclosures library.

1. **UI/UX:** The UX/UI team iterated on graphic charts and identities, interface, and user flows. A sample can be found below:

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*XqGrL4EzzfTWH02rhMjpBQ.jpeg)3. **Production:** During this period the development team worked on 2 main tasks — we have started to integrate the platform and work on the centralized/static parts of the platform (frontend integration, backend, etc.), while at the same time we had to prepare the creation of the Smart Contract, map the planned processes, plan the SCORE structure, etc.

4. **Prototype:** Check out the overview [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/yBFLqsy9SBeqackrONAX8g/FutureICX-%7C-Demo-%231?node-id=2492%3A3813&viewport=9%2C944%2C0.041623037308454514&scaling=min-zoom).

5. **Reward structure**: See below.

* **Daily prediction** — rewards distributed according to the player’s prediction accuracy for a specific day compared to the other players. Rewards 40% of the placed prediction amounts with a max multiplier of 4.5x for the most accurate players.
* **Weekly prediction** — an alternative to the Daily prediction option for the players that prefer to look at longer trading periods. Identical rewards with 40% rewarded with a 4.5x max multiplier
* **Bullseye prediction** — a weekly prediction type for the more confident/daring players. Offers a steep reward system with 15% of the prediction amounts rewarded but with a strong 7x max multiplier — weekly returns that traders can rarely get even in the most powerful bull runs
* **Weekly reward pool** — a reward pool, distributed weekly and rewarding the top performers throughout the week
* **Monthly reward pool** — a pool rewarding the top-performing players monthly

### [DappReview Update #1](https://forum.icon.community/t/report-dapp-integration-on-dappreview/658)
