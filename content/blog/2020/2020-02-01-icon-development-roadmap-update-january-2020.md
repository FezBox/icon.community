### ICON Development Roadmap Update — January 2020

Greetings ICONists,

The new year is off to a fast start for the ICON project and January was another great month of progress as we strive to fulfill our original vision of hyper-connecting the world. We continued to improve network stability, started development on our contribution proposal system to help accelerate the growth in the ecosystem, and are developing security features to enhance our network. This month, we also completed our interchain proof of concept (POC) for private to public chain interoperability. We hope to share a demo of this to the community very soon.

Additionally, the core team is very close to finalizing our 2020 roadmap. In it, we will highlight several key focus areas for the remainder of the year. This roadmap will act as guideline for development but may be subject to change given the dynamic and ever-changing blockchain industry.

#### **Network Stabilization**

This month, we released an updated loopchain and ICON service docker. Additionally, a new block structure will be implemented to support the Block Recovery Function. The details of the release can be found here (<https://www.icondev.io/changelog/release-note>) and summarized below:

**Loopchain 2.5.01**

* Adjusted peer loading priority
* Modified retrieving candidate blocks
* Fixed make requirements in Ubuntu

**Loopchain 2.5.00**

* Added command line to print loopchain version and dependencies
* Modified handshake for Citizen
* Fixed leader complaint
* Added Block Recovery function to delete unconfirmed blocks
* Block structure updated to version 0.5

**ICON Service 1.6.00**

* Support diverged block recovery

#### Contribution Proposal System

Core team members have begun the development of the contribution proposal system. With the introduction of this system, all those who seek to contribute to the ICON network will have the opportunity. The Foundation is extremely excited about the contribution proposal system and is looking forward to sharing more details on the development status in the coming months.

#### **Security enhancements**

Finally, we are developing the P-Rep node key duplication function to increase the security of the ICON Node software. With this update, we will separate the public key for reward receipt and governance with the operational public key for consensus to protect each node from Node malicious actors. Once implemented, even if a malicious actor were to take over a P-Rep Node’s server, they would not be able to exploit governance power.

Thank you,

ICON Foundation
