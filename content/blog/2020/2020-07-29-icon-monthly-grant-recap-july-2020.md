Greetings ICONists,

It was another busy month of grant applications and approvals and we continue to be encouraged by the quality of new initiatives. Like in prior month’s we’ll go through each approval in more detail below. But separately, we want to announce a change to the grant program that we believe better aligns the interests of the community.

Today, we’re happy to announce that going forward we will be combining the grant program and the P-Rep delegation program.

### What does this mean?

* Anyone approved for a grant will be eligible to receive 1M ICX delegation for the duration of the grant
* If you are working on multiple grants at the same time, you will be eligible to combine delegation up to 3x (e.g. the maximum you can earn is 3M ICX delegation if you are working on three separate grants)
* If the grant worker does not have a node, we will encourage them to set one up in order to get delegation
* This will begin on August 10th at the end of the current delegation program
* For people already working on grants, they will receive it retroactively

As mentioned before, we feel this change best accomplishes the goal of aligning incentives (i.e. rewards) with contribution. Additionally it provides the greatest transparency to the community and is the simplest design to manage. It also encourages more applications for grants, which we think is a big positive for the network and its continued growth.

We look forward to seeing the results of these changes and as always will be looking to make improvements over time.

### K- Pop Content Promoter: Stayge

STAYGE One is developing a blockchain-based service innovating the entertainment industry. This service, K-Pop Content Promoter, is a system recording how much the K-Pop fans are contributing to the expansion of K-Pop content.

The Content Promoter will evaluate the distribution status of target content based on the following 3 steps.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*nkvg8M8ckWexfYcE)*Step 1* — Various kinds of content will be gathered at the Fan Community of STAYGE from many content sources including YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter.

*Step 2* — Content gathered at STAYGE will be converted into personalized and shareable URL links. Such links will lead to the same content of the sources while having personal information including user data, link-generation time, and so on.

*Step 3* — When the generated links are shared with blogs and communities, the referral information will be recorded to see which pathways the links have been taken.

Throughout the 3 steps and collected data, STAYGE will know which fans have been contributing to the distribution of content and set a standard to give out rewards based on their contribution.

### New Dapp integrations: Tipicon — Piconbello

Since its inception Tipicon has been a success. For example, in nearly 2 weeks after the Iconbet integration, it managed to create 500,000 transactions with 5 million ICX in volume. This number continues to rise as top users of Iconbet utilize Tipicon to play the games.

At one time, Tipicon created 35% of the transactions for Iconbet and helped them become #1 dApp in terms of transactions according to [dapp.com](http://dapp.com/). Currently, in the first month, Tipicon handled 1 million transactions. The team expects this to grow substantially as more integrations are completed. Next on the list of integrations is Iconswap, a decentralized exchange built and managed by ICONation.

Overall, each additional dApp integration will take 3 weeks, including testing and such, which makes 3 months in total.

As part of this approval, the team must submit Periodic Reports by the timeframes below (UTC):

### Project Nebula — ICON Forge

Project Nebula is a space themed collectible strategy game on the ICON blockchain. It will be released as a cross-platform browser game to ensure accessibility to the widest possible audience. The individual unique planets in Project Nebula will be non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which players can claim inside the game and trade or sell if they wish to do so. There will be several rarity categories for the planets — each planet will have unique design and attributes that will determine how useful and powerful they will be in the game. The game will also include elements from the “4X” genre such as exploration, research and resource management.

Below are images of the planets, exploration features and the marketplace. We are very excited about the use of ICON’s NFT standard and look forward to seeing the progress of Project Nebula.

### Blockchain Analytics — Insight Data Science

Insight intends to track the growth and adoption of ICON. They believe that when the process is built right, insights can be gained in near real time to track items such as monthly active wallets or number of transactions for individual smart contracts and DApps over time. By analyzing the blockchain’s adoption, the community can gain insights into user behavior and act on them by directing resources more appropriately to increase transactions.

This proposal focuses on building a robust business analytics tool suite to support blockchain analytics. It will use the same architecture being used on the top blockchains per the [blockchain-etl github organization](https://github.com/blockchain-etl) by orchestrating data pipelines with [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) and inserting the data into various relational databases for further analysis. The project will then build dashboards with [Apache Superset](https://superset.incubator.apache.org/) for analysis with a long term support for additional metrics requested by the community. These visualizations can then be embedded into various block explorers or used by individuals doing exploratory analysis.

We agree that analytical tools to measure blockchain adoption and activity are necessary in order to grow our ecosystem.

As part of this approval, the team must submit Periodic Reports by the timeframes below (UTC):

* 2020/07/22 02:00 AM (UTC)
* 2020/08/20 02:00 AM (UTC)
* 2020/09/20 02:00 AM (UTC)

**Funding Amount**

The ICON Foundation is going to give out $20,000 in 3 monthly installments based on the Periodic Report. The amount of ICX will be determined and paid according to the price at 02:00 AM (UTC) on the day of payment.

* 2020/07/24 02:00 AM (UTC) — $6,666
* 2020/08/24 02:00 AM (UTC) — $6,666
* 2020/09/24 02:00 AM (UTC) — $6,667

### ICON Contract Hub — Yudas Lab

Yudas Lab will be improving the developer experience by building blockchain tools for the ICON Network. Below are the new tools to be built:

**Primary**

1. *Transaction history viewer, categorized by external and internal TXs.*Similar to a mini tracker, with features/UI designed and well-tailored for SCORE development only.
2. *Favorite contracts*, a bookmark of contracts, to help us quickly get back to contracts being worked on.

**Secondary**

1. *Wallet swarm simulator*, quickly create/import wallets and imitate real world user behaviors which will be very convenient for testing/interacting with contracts.
2. *Contract stats*, it helps developers quickly grasp their contract metrics like TX count and volume.

**Optional**

1. *Aiming for “backendless” architecture*, the whole thing is a one-page application running on a browser without the need for communicating with an external API backend ( for instance, query pre-processed TX data ).
2. *Migrate codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript*, for better code readability as well as maintenance/contribution

We agree that blockchain tooling on ICON needs to be improved and are excited about working alongside Yudas Lab.

The team must submit the Periodic Report by the timeframes below (UTC):

* 2020/08/11 02:00 AM (UTC)
* 2020/09/08 02:00 AM (UTC)

**Funding Amount**
