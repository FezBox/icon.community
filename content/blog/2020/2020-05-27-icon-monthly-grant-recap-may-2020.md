### ICON Monthly Grant Recap — May 2020

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*v70d_unzLinryv4Kp5d3mA.png)Simplex Integration and Liquid ICX

Greetings ICONists,

We’re happy to share the latest progress with ICON’s community grant program. As we’ve done in prior months, in this report, we’ll take a closer look at the grants approved by the Foundation thus far in May. Additionally, we’ll highlight updates to periodic reporting and the respective progress of our previously funded grants. Enjoy!

### May 2020

It was another busy month for grant applications and we’ve approved 2 grants thus far; 1 for infrastructure and 1 DApp. If we approve any more in the coming days, we’ll be sure to provide more details on any we miss in next month’s update. But for now, please see the details below.

#### Approvals thus far:

* *Infrastructure***:** [Simplex Integration](https://www.simplex.com)
* *DApp*: [Liquid ICX (LICX) — Token for DeFi](https://licx.finance)

#### [Simplex Integration](https://www.simplex.com)

Simplex provides fiat-onramps to the leading exchanges, wallets and other service providers throughout the industry. With this integration, crypto enthusiasts will be able to purchase ICX directly with their cards at a number of Simplex partner sites.

As part of this integration, ICX will be added to the list of crypto assets offered with this service (i.e. fiat on-ramp). We would be added to the following assets currently available:

* ATOM, BCH, BNB, BTC, BUSD, CEL, DAI, DASH, EOS, ETH, LTC, LUNA, NANO, PAX, SDT, SGA, TRX, USDT, XAUT, XLM, XRP

As part of the approval, Simplex will integrate ICX within ~1 month of signing our agreement.

* The Foundation is providing $50,000 in the form of a deposit for integration and compliance costs.
* The Foundation can earn back this deposit based on the fees generated by the Simplex service over 6 months.
* If Simplex generates $50,000 over the same period, ICON will receive the full deposit back.
* Note, this is a one-time deposit (fee structure).

#### [Liquid ICX (LICX) — Token for DeFi](https://licx.finance/)

LICX is the basis for DeFi solutions. It is an IRC2 token that represents staked ICX making it possible to be transferred without compromising the security of the network. This provides an alternative option to exchanges for ICONists to receive rewards while keeping liquidity of their ICX.

This will reduce the amount of control that exchanges can get over the network by providing extra liquidity to the network as well as allow the ICONists to be in possession of their private keys, ICX in the pool will be controlled by a smart contract so there is no central authority involved.

LICX will also increase the number of transactions on the network as it will allow stakeholders to do other transactions than claiming and re-staking.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*u92hwXEyCqhePy7T)**Project milestones**

The LICX team want to implement 3 major milestones for this project:

* **Milestone #1 — α-Version**Alpha testing. Functionalities: Minting/burning LICX via a simple web application.
* **Milestone #2 — β-Version**Beta testing. Functionalities: Staking and voting implemented. Improve web application UI.
* **Milestone #3 — MVP**Deployment of MVP on the main net. Web application functions finished.  
We will have 6 sprints each lasting 2 weeks after every sprint we will provide a progress report. We dedicated 2 sprints or 1 month for each version of the project. Estimated release date is at the end of Q2 2020

As part of the approval, the Liquid ICX team must submit Periodic Reports by the timeframes below (UTC):

* 2020/05/28 02:00 AM (UTC)
* 2020/06/24 02:00 AM (UTC)

**Funding Amount**

The ICON Foundation will provide $23,400 in 2 monthly installments based on the Periodic Reports. The amount of ICX will be determined and paid according to the price at 02:00 AM (UTC) on the day of payment.

* 2020/05/29 02:00 AM (UTC) — $11,700
* 2020/06/25 02:00 AM (UTC) — $11,700

### Periodic Updates

#### [Dapp.com integration](https://www.dapp.com/ranking/ICON?)

All the work in the first stage is finished but Dapp.com will take it further from here. They will continue to provide stats, exposure and keep track of all the progress within ICON ecosystem.

Moving on they will also be adding any tools, use cases of ICON that touch the blockchain component (not just dapps) to [dapp.com](http://dapp.com/). And strongly believe that this will continue to generate awareness to the ICON ecosystem. As the first dapp platform partnered with ICON, Dapp.com is 100% committed to grow with the ICON ecosystem.

#### [**FutureICX Report #2**](https://www.futureicx.io)

**1. UI/UX**

In the past month FutureICX has started making the transition from a conceptualized product to a real-world one.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*oTtMulZvX_jBOMHV)**2. Storytelling**

Created new “EYEcons” so the options for different player avatars has increased even more. They have also been assigned to provide further info on some of the app’s sections and the general tutorial of FutureICX.

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Kd9Hnjl8T_cLyv7G)**3. Score development**

The development of the FutureICX SCORE has already started! During this month, the FutureICX team has set the app’s foundations — the contracts and their interactions. As FutureICX has a pretty complex reward system, each separate functionality takes rigorous testing so that it’s done properly.

**4. WebApp development**

By moving from the conceptual prototype to the WebApp platform, the important thing was to tie up correctly the visual concept, the UI, and the completed functions of the Score.

**5. Early Alpha demo**

The team will provide a link with the demo login details in the forum and with it welcome anyone that would like to try an early version of our app out.

**6. Future plans**

In the last month of development ***(FutureICX is planned for release at the end of June 2020)***, the team is planning to completely finalize the development of the app, to implement the remaining score and WebApp functionalities, to set up the mobile UI, conclude the tests done on Testnet and move on to Mainnet by setting up a decentralized oracle solution in order to ensure fair and accurate results.
