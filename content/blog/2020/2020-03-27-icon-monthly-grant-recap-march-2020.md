## ICON Monthly Grant Recap — March 2020

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*m7cXZjUhHz5G1p8Eg_FCRg.png)New Initiative to Provide Monthly Updates on Approved and Funded Grants

Greetings ICONists,

We are very pleased to announce a **new initiative to provide monthly grant updates** to keep the community informed of the initiatives ICON Foundation is funding with its Representative rewards. As you know, the Foundation is committed to reinvesting 100% of its Representative rewards into the ecosystem. And we believe this initiative will provide better transparency into these efforts while also highlighting important ecosystem developments.

As part of this new update, each month, we’ll take a closer look at the Foundation approved grants, their respective progress against expectations, and updates to periodic reporting status.

Today, we’ll provide a recap of all the approved grants year to date. We also revisit the assessment framework used to review applications and provide an overview of the review process from the initial application to the final payment. In later posts, we’ll focus primarily on any **new developments or activity** relative to the prior month. This is the first iteration of this initiative and we plan to make improvements over time.

## Assessment Framework

When reviewing the grant applications, the approval committee focuses primarily on three categories. These categories are outlined below:

### Proposal Overview:

* Does this benefit the ICON Network and/or community?
* Does the proposal provide enough information?
* Are there any risks for the ICON community with this proposal?
* Is there an overlap between the proposal and other initiatives?

### Feasibility:

* Is the roadmap reasonable?
* Do the team members have a relevant background?

### Public Good and Transparency:

* Does the project fairly justify its budget?
* Are the deliverables and milestones verifiable and tangible?

## Review Process

The grant review committee convenes each Wednesday to discuss proposals based on the above assessment criteria. From there, the operating procedure is as follows:

* A 2 week assessment period by committee members
* An initial review result
* A final review result
* Then if approved, periodic reporting and payment

Below is a flow chart describing the process in greater detail.

As noted above, we will provide a recap of the grants funded year to date. In the months ahead, we’ll only focus on changes from the prior month.

## January 2020

In January, we reviewed a total of 9 grant applications and approved 2; an approval rate of 22%. Of the approved grants, one was developer-focused and the other focused on infrastructure.

### **Approvals:**

* *Education:* [devblockchain.tech](https://www.devblockchain.tech/) ([Sharpn](https://twitter.com/sharpntech))
* *Infrastructure:* [MyICONwallet](https://www.myiconwallet.com/) ([Reliant Node](https://twitter.com/ReliantNode))

### [Devblockchain.tech Development update #1](https://forum.icon.community/t/devblockchain-tech-development-update-1/400):

Devblockchain.tech is a platform that aims to provide a 3-part learning experience on SCORE (Smart Contract on Reliable Environment):

* **Discover**: It would be useless to learn how to develop Smart Contracts without knowing the fundamentals of Blockchain technologies, their possible applications and the philosophy of this ecosystem. This short part will aim at educating users about these principles.
* **Learn**: This section is the main part of the platform. It will allow users to learn interactively the development of SCORE in several chapters.
* **Build**: To conclude, Sharpn will present all the professional opportunities available for ICON Ecosystem builders. Sharpn will present examples of teams and programs such as EEP or DPB.

Sharpn is aiming for a release on March 31st and will have 2–3 weeks dedicated to QA and background work on the Earn Campaign. ‘Sharpn Earn’ rewards selected users who complete the first course with a $15 ICX reward.
