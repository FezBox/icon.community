## Governance: What It Means to Blockchain Projects (Virtual Meetup)

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*QkMy7rkJkIc0a-nwRKFzAQ.png)Greetings ICONists,

**On July 30th at 5pm (PST)**, we will host an online meetup with leading blockchain projects, MakerDAO and Tezos. Wilson Withiam, Research Analyst at Messari, will be the host for the panel discussion. Daeki Lee, Head of Ecosystem at ICON Foundation, Kevin Nielsen, Associate at TQ Tezos, and Charles St.Louis, Decentralized Governance Architect at Maker Foundation will participate in the [panel discussion](https://www.airmeet.com/e/e7cc9240-c756-11ea-9bea-3146952c640d) about governance.

Governance is an integral part of blockchain projects, yet there is still no proven approach while many blockchain projects continue experimenting with the governance of their ecosystem. As the ICON project went through decentralization last Fall, the team has learned many important lessons along the way and thought that it would be a good idea to share these lessons while learning from other blockchain projects that have gone through the decentralization process as well. With that in mind, we invited Tezos and Maker DAO, two blockchain projects that are well known in the industry for active governance of the ecosystem, to join us for a panel discussion on governance.

We hope to have a candid discussion about the latest status on the governance of each blockchain project and believe that this meetup will provide a good overview on various approaches to the governance of blockchain projects. As many defi platforms issue governance tokens, the governance topic is becoming increasingly more important. We hope that the lessons shared in this panel can inspire many who are interested in learning more about blockchain governance and in experimenting with a new governance approach.
