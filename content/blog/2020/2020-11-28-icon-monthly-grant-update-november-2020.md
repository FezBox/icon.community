Greetings ICONists,

We are very pleased to approve another 6 grants in November capping off a successful ICON Community Grant program. The 6 grants consist of many exciting initiatives including community building/marketing, an NFT marketplace, and more applications of $ICX.

Last December, the ICON Foundation announced the ICON Community Grant Program and since then, we have proudly funded more than 45 projects that have directly benefited the ICON community. At that time we stated, “this program will operate until the CPS is fully developed and implemented on the ICON Network.” Now, we’re excited to say that time has come.

Starting in December, the current [ICON Community Grant Program](https://medium.com/helloiconworld/icon-community-grant-program-2551a1d84d1) will transition to the [Contribution Proposal System (CPS)](https://medium.com/stakin/icons-contribution-proposal-system-explained-e610efcba346), a decentralized on-chain grant program collectively managed by the Public Representatives (“P-Reps”) of the ICON network and the Foundation will launch a new ICON Foundation Grant Program which you can read more about [here](https://medium.com/helloiconworld/icon-foundation-grant-program-2020-653b626abaeb).

As always, we continue to be encouraged by the community’s commitment and participation in the grant process and hope to continue helping entrepreneurs and dedicated ICONists on their endeavors through both the CPS and the ICON Foundation program.

Below is a recap of this month’s approved grants. Please check them out and support your fellow ICONists!

### [‘Spread Your Votes’ campaign by ICON in Numbers](https://forum.icon.community/t/grant-application-spread-your-votes-campaign-by-icon-in-numbers/1319)

ICON in Numbers is a joint project between P-Reps Transcranial Solutions and Espanicon. The goal of the weekly report is to analyze different aspects of data, including voting behavior so the team could track the changes over time and inform ICONists and P-Reps to improve the governance in the ICON ecosystem.

The teams have been tracking the number of P-Reps that ICONists were voting for since their report on the [voter behavior](https://medium.com/@transcranial.solutions/icon-network-p-rep-vote-distribution-and-voter-behaviour-5bd3e7771922), and this was implemented in the weekly ICON in Numbers article since July, 2020. They have also shown an indicator for the highest number of P-Reps voted each week after the implementation of the upgrade on the ICON network which allowed for voting of more than 10 P-Reps. The team kept track of the data and helped increase awareness by sharing the data each week via [social media platforms](https://twitter.com/TranscranialSol/status/1296577578778546177).

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*Bqqb4errVIafpKaO)The team started a ‘Spread Your Votes’ campaign where they encouraged ICONists to spread their votes. With this grant, the team is giving ICONists the incentives to vote for more P-Reps so that the votes are not too concentrated on the top P-Reps. We have seen a gradual increase in the number of wallets and votes in the ‘11+ P-Reps’ voted category.

**Project Milestones:**

* Four (4) ICON in Numbers report per month in two languages (English & Spanish)
* One (1) summary report per month in English (Trend Analysis)

### [LICX governance and Audit](https://forum.icon.community/t/licx-governance-and-audit/1321)

LICX is already receiving a lot of interest and given it could hold a significant amount of ICX in a smart contract, the team wants to fund an audit of the protocol. Additionally, the team is building governance functions around the delegation process for the staked ICX. Below are the respective milestones for this approved grant.

**The team wants to implement 3 major milestones for this project:**

* **Milestone #1 — MVP**  
Smart contract and testing. Functionalities: LICX holders can vote for their desired P-rep(s)
* **Milestone #2 — Final version**  
Website, documentation, and testing. Functionalities: functions of MVP, website implementation, and documentation.
* **Milestone #3 — Audited protocol**

Sharpn believes enabling an NFT based ecosystem will be invaluable for the ICON network and now is the time. They also believe that this will generate solid organic activities and vitalize our community with a genuine use case.

The platform will have a marketplace for creators to mint NFTs, list them for sale, and gain royalties from each sale. Collectors can also direct buy from the marketplace to build their collection of interests. The NFTs can be in the form of digital collectibles, such as [art NFTs](https://cointelegraph.com/news/tokenized-art-nfts-paint-bright-future-for-artists-blockchain-tech). We also plan to expand the service to other forms of digital items such as crypto domain service INS (ICON Name Service).

Last but not least, the project will be DAO based with its own governance token, where holders can weigh in on platform development directions, community to decide what content to feature, and artist to approve etc.

**Project Duration:** 3 months to complete phase 1

**Project Milestones:**

*Phase 1*

* Brand and token identity
* UX/UI prototypes
* MVP of the webApp with selling/buying feature
* Create, buy and sell NFTs (royalties, commission fees)
* User profile, ICONex and ledger login
* NFT profile, gallery, and purchase history
* Governance token, reward distribution
* Collections, and “featured” section
* Discussion forum
* Discord community
* DAO vote

*Phase 2*

* Bridge login (account) and payments (deposit, withdrawal)
* INS (ICON Name Service) NFTs
* Tangible NFTs
* Social features (likes, comments, share on twitter etc)

Thank you,

ICON Foundation
