Greetings ICONists,

This month was highlighted by the announcement of our new and improved blockchain, ICON 2.0: BATANG. For the past year, we have been developing this new technology, and it’s one of our most important achievements to date.We provide the latest timeline and testnet information below.

## ICON 2.0: BATANG

This month, we announced our next significant technical advancement — ICON 2.0: BATANG, that we have been working on for a year.

We are completely overhauling the ICON mainnet launched in 2018, and ICON 2.0 will come standard with interoperability features to support and power cross-chain DeFi solutions. Further details on the ICON 2.0 BATANG feature set can be found [here](https://medium.com/helloiconworld/icon-2-0-introducing-a-new-blockchain-software-architecture-based-on-go-8874107a4e58).

Goloop core modules are complete, and implementations for enterprise use-cases have already begun. Additionally, we have started working on the public modules to support the ICON 2.0 protocol.

Currently, we are planning to release the alpha version of the ICON 2.0 implemented Goloop by Feb 2021 and to complete all data migration work by June 2021. Note, the timeline and details are subject to change depending on the technical difficulty and resource plan. Users and developers will not need to take any action for the migration process.

We will share additional details regarding the migration process after completing the alpha version of ICON 2.0 implemented Goloop.

## ICON 2.0 Testnet Gangnam set to launch at the end of Oct 2020

One of the significant improvements of ICON 2.0 is the Java virtual machine that enables the Java SCORE. The Java SCORE running on the virtual machine is a new SCORE execution environment that no longer requires the smart contract audit process conducted by the Foundation. To introduce our community developers to this new environment, we are planning to launch a new testnet, Gangnam, which is powered by the Goloop base modules that support Java SCORE. The testnet will launch at the end of October 2020.

Stay tuned for more details.

Thank you,

ICON Foundation
