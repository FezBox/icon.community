## ICON Monthly Grant Recap — September 2020

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0AMbanlzFUK4rKslBukkKQ.png)New ICON-focused Website

Greetings ICONists,

In September, we’ve approved 1 grant to build a new and informative website/portal for the ICON project. This website will include introductory information for new ICONists looking to explore ICON as well as detailed information for the more seasoned crypto-community members.

Given the limited number of approved grants this month, we’ll also provide a recap of progress reports received over the past several weeks that have been approved by the Foundation below. As a reminder, we are actively seeking to deploy funds to interested teams/individuals to help grow our ecosystem. Any interested parties should apply [here](https://forum.icon.community/c/g/31) for consideration. We look forward to supporting your initiatives.

### [ICONrepublic.org](https://forum.icon.community/t/grant-application-the-icon-republic-www-iconrepublic-org/1179)

Currently, the ICON Foundation website is in need of a re-design and doesn’t contain the most up to date information related to (or fully reflect) all of the aspects of the ICON project. [www.iconrepublic.org](http://www.iconrepublic.org/) will be a website which will be a ‘one-stop’ solution for all those who want to learn and understand ICON and not just the Foundation’s role. It will be for both hardened crypto enthusiasts and for crypto beginners. [ICON Hyperconnect](https://www.iconhyperconnect.com) will showcase ICON’s full potential and initiatives in an accessible (single glance), aesthetically pleasing manner.

The team believes that in the current crypto climate, a concise, graphic-heavy (including a video) website can serve to be extremely effective in introducing ICON to beginners and being a useful portal for even seasoned ICONists. To be clear, this is **not** going to be a website where ICON ecosystem members interact.

It will be a dynamic informative website which will require constant updates as ICON makes progress. Think of it as an aesthetically pleasing A-Z introduction to ICON (ICON 101) which will involve the creation of a lot of introductory content regarding ICON, and be a curated portal to the best available resources for ICON.

**Project Duration:** The [ICON Hyperconnect](https://www.iconhyperconnect.com) team expects the website to be up and running within 2 months.

As part of the approval process, the team must submit the Periodic Report by the timeframes below (UTC):

* 2020/09/23 02:00 AM (UTC)
* 2020/10/20 02:00 AM (UTC)
* 2020/11/20 02:00 AM (UTC)

**Funding Amount**

The ICON Foundation is going to give out $9,500 in 3 monthly installments based on the Periodic Report. The amount of ICX will be determined and paid according to the price at 02:00 AM (UTC) on the day of payment.

* 2020/09/24 02:00 AM (UTC) — $3,166
* 2020/10/23 02:00 AM (UTC) — $3,166
* 2020/11/24 02:00 AM (UTC) — $3,167

## Progress Reports

### [ICON Africa and ICX Army](https://forum.icon.community/t/icon-africa-development-initiative-icxarmy-report/1214/2)

### [Bridge and ICON documentation](https://forum.icon.community/t/bridge-and-icon-documentation-periodic-reports/1210)

As previously noted, Parrot9 plans to complete Bridge before moving on to the ICON documentation. Here is the latest info for Bridge.

* Created the Bridge brand
* Designed the core user flows (sign in, KYC, deposit, send) and various other parts of the widget UI
* Built the designs in HTML and CSS
* Outlined the Bridge website content

And here are the project milestones:

* Branding — 85% completed
* UI/UX design — 70% completed
* Front-end markup — 70% completed
* Website — 25% completed
* Marketing and support materials — 0% completed

Currently the project is 65% complete and the remaining time to completion is 8 weeks.

### [OpenDevICON (ODI) Continuing Development](https://forum.icon.community/t/periodic-report-opendevicon-odi-continuing-development/1213)

Just like the IRC2 library, Ibriz has initiated a SCORE library for Non Fungible Tokens(NFT) as well. We have created an [IRC3 Library 1](https://github.com/OpenDevICON/odi-contracts/tree/master/ODIContracts/tokens/IRC3)based on IRC3 standard, that will support creation of IRC3 tokens providing additional functionality than IRC3 standard.

* IRC3 Mintable Token
* IRC3 Burnable Token
* IRC3 Updatable Token
* IRC3 Pausable Token

We have added roles feature in this IRC3 Library, so that only the address with roles to mint/burn the tokens can do respective token operations.

Thus far 33% of the project has been completed and all tasks planned for this period (Month 1) were completed.

During the next period, Ibriz plans further testing and cleanup of the SCORE libraries, addition of an IRC16 library will be done as well as a demo app for Band Protocol Oracle Integration.

Thank you,

ICON Foundation
