Greetings from the ICON team,

We are proud to announce the [successful audit](https://medium.com/@certik.io/certiks-audit-of-icon-s-python-implementation-of-the-service-engine-be5b8e359f5c) performed by [**CertiK**](https://certik.org/).

CertiK,is the leading blockchain security company, founded by Computer Science professors from Yale and Columbia University. They pioneered using [Formal Verification](https://medium.com/certik/an-introduction-to-formal-verification-8f4523278e77) technology to perform comprehensive mathematical computations that are able to identify undetected vulnerabilities in a project’s source code. They have helped secure some of the largest blockchain projects in the space by combining their deep domain expertise, proprietary tooling and unique techniques.

Maintaining high security is a necessity for any decentralized network. ICON is one of the largest leading decentralized networks in the world and the largest in Korea, but we know that our network is only as strong as the underlying code. Certik’s audit has provided peace of mind that our smart contract code is secure.

Min Kim, Co-Founder of the ICON Project, noted “We have known the Certik team for many years and continue to be impressed by their growth as the leading formal verification and auditing solution for the space and the strength of their team. We’re excited to partner with them on our most recent audit and look forward to working with them again closely in the future.”

“We are proud to have conducted yet another successful audit for the ICON project. We believe security is crucial when it comes to the mass adoption of decentralized applications and we are thrilled to know that the ICON team is doing everything it can to ensure the security of their systems.” said Yvan Nasr, Head of Professional Services at certik.io

Thank you,

ICON Foundation
