We are pleased to announce that the Enterprise Blockchain Awards (EBAs) judging committee have made their decisions on the [finalists](https://blockchainrevolutionglobal.com/the-eb-awards/) for the annual Enterprise Blockchain Awards! ICONLOOP is one of four finalists in the subcategory: **Innovative Entrepreneurship in Blockchain — Technology & Platforms**. Each subcategory will have one winner, which will be announced at the EBA Gala event on April 8th, 2020, in Toronto, Ontario, following the conclusion of the [Blockchain Revolution Global (BRG) conference](https://blockchainrevolutionglobal.com/), one of the leading enterprise-focused blockchain conferences in the world.

*“We are extremely excited to be recognized alongside the thought leaders in the blockchain industry”, noted JH Kim, CEO of ICONLOOP. “Our innovative decentralized identity products have made significant strides in Korea and we’re very pleased to see our work recognized globally”.*

ICON Foundation participated in the inaugural BRG conference last year as a platform sponsor collaborating with leading blockchain and enterprise companies to discuss adoption, regulation, security, identity, and innovation in the space. Additionally, Ricky Dodds participated in a panel discussion alongside Ethan Buchman (Co-Founder and CTO, Tendermint and Cosmos), and Matt Roszak (Chairman and Co-Founder, Bloq) discussing enterprise platforms of tomorrow.

ICONLOOP is being honored alongside some of the largest and most recognized players in the blockchain industry including IBM Blockchain, Microsoft, and Figure Technologies. Members of the ICON Foundation and ICONLOOP will be in attendance at the event and look forward to sharing the great progress we’ve made over the past year with the over 1000+ expected corporate, academic, and government leaders in attendance.

Thank you,

ICON Foundation
