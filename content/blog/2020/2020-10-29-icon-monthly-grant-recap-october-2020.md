We continue to be encouraged by the community’s commitment and participation in the grant process and hope to help many more entrepreneurs and dedicated ICONists in their efforts to grow our ecosystem.

Please see below for more details on the approved grants this month and keep the applications coming!

### [Icon Pilipinas Community Building Growth Accelerator #2](https://forum.icon.community/t/grant-application-icon-pilipinas-community-building-growth-accelerator-2/1236/4)

Icon Pilipinas focuses on accelerating blockchain growth in the Philippines by educating the masses and common everyday people about ICON — The major benefits and why it should be a premier blockchain project people here think about and use in the Philippines.

With the help of the [first grant application approval](https://forum.icon.community/t/grant-application-icon-pilipinas-community-building-growth-accelerator/908) (submitted on June 22, 2020), the Icon Pilipinas social media channels were able to grow to the following numbers:

**Telegram**: <https://t.me/icon_pilipinas>

* 4,155 followers (up from 459 on June 22).

**Facebook**: <https://www.facebook.com/IconPilipinas/>

* 57,283 followers (up from 53,000 on June 22).

**YouTube**: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqkwvlG2636SqqtjOYAxOhQ 2](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqkwvlG2636SqqtjOYAxOhQ)

* 1,272 followers (up from 237 followers on June 22).

**Twitter**: [https://twitter.com/IconPilipinas 2](https://twitter.com/IconPilipinas)

* 2,974 (up from 408 followers on June 22).

As part of their growth strategy, the Icon Pilipinas team launched ICX News Ngayon [in early July](https://youtu.be/kCQzWWR403I) and has been consistently producing new episodes ever since. To be clear, ICON is the only topic of conversation discussed here; each week, the team picks out a key news piece related to the ICON ecosystem and breaks it down in basic terms for non-techies.

To help complement the efforts with ICX News Ngayon, the team also started featuring a new event, ICX News Ngayon Quiz Time, on their Facebook page, which also debuted in early July.

Additionally, the Icon Pilipinas team has created one of the largest and most active telegram groups in the Philippines.

### [**Project Nebula (NFT collectible game) 2nd Grant**](https://forum.icon.community/t/grant-application-project-nebula-nft-collectible-game-2nd-grant/1235/4)

Project Nebula is a space-themed collectible strategy game on the ICON blockchain. It will be released as a cross-platform browser game to ensure accessibility to the widest possible audience. The individual unique planets in Project Nebula will be non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which players can claim inside the game and trade or sell if they wish to do so. Planets come in several rarity classes — each planet will have unique designs and attributes that will determine how useful and powerful they will be in the game. The game will also include elements from the “4X” genre such as exploration, research, and resource management.

The team successfully completed the first 3 stages of the whole project with the help of ICON’s first grant ([Grant Application] Project Nebula (NFT collectible game](https://forum.icon.community/t/grant-application-project-nebula-nft-collectible-game/874)), they are now applying for an additional grant to continue working towards releasing the full game.

A significant part of the funding is planned for ordering new artwork and soundtracks for Project Nebula. Collectible art and sound pieces play an important role in creating an immersive experience for the players. The market for NFT art is currently growing at an incredible speed, which is why we really believe that having high-quality art is integral to the success of this game.
