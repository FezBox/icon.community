![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qOZ3DvbODpidmjzFaP0ZmQ.png)UPDATED DATE/TIME: Meet-up with MakerDAO, Chainlink and ICON

Greetings ICONists,

**On March 18th at 7pm (KST)**, we will host a joint meet-up alongside leading blockchain projects, MakerDAO and Chainlink. We are happy to host Kim Jin-woo, General Manager of Korean Community of MakerDao and Yeongin Lee, Korea lead for Chainlink. Bongan Ha, Cryptoeconomic architect of ICON, will also participate in the meet-up by discussing interchain and ICON’s roadmap.

Each of these projects are well-known globally within the finance, oracle, and interchain focus areas. During our discussions, we’ll help visualize these topics in more detail and hopefully give you a clearer picture of how they can be developed to bring blockchain adoption to the masses.

**Introduction to participating projects:**

MakerDAO

Maker is a smart contract platform on Ethereum that backs and stabilizes the value of Dai through a dynamic system of Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs), autonomous feedback mechanisms, and appropriately incentivized external actors. Maker enables anyone to leverage their Ethereum assets to generate Dai on the Maker Platform. The Dai Stablecoin is a collateral-backed cryptocurrency whose value is stable relative to the US Dollar. Unlike other Stablecoins, Dai is completely decentralized.

Chainlink

Chainlink is a decentralized oracle solution that allows smart contracts to connect off-chain data used by data feeds, Web APIs and traditional banking systems. Chainlink is known to provide reliable and reliable Oracle for many projects (Web3 / Polkadot, Synthetix, Loopring, Kaleido, OpenLaw, Reserve, etc.), as well as many large companies such as Google, Oracle, and Swift.

ICON Network

ICON Network is a public blockchain network that builds a real life environment of blockchain technology through the connection of various blockchain communities based on the “loopchain”, a high-performance blockchain engine. Based on smart contract technology and interchain technology, we provide interoperability with heterogeneous blockchains in major industries such as banks, securities, insurance, hospitals, universities, and governments. ICON Network aims to move towards a truly hyperconnected society by removing barriers in the exchange of values ​​between blockchains.

Thank you,

ICON
