Greetings ICONists,

We’re happy to share the latest progress with ICON’s community grant program.

Additionally, we’ll highlight updates to periodic reporting and the respective progress of our previously funded grants. Enjoy!

### [Social Media Engagement and Growth Accelerator](https://forum.icon.community/t/icon-grant-proposal-social-media-engagement-growth-accelerator/720/2)

ICONPLUS is going to run a social media engagement and growth accelerator program. Here are the things they are focused on:

* Outreach within the crypto community to grow market share. Other projects are actively investing on this side of business and without an equally aggressive approach we risk losing market share. ICONPLUS has noticed that general ICX engagement has increased and with this project they intend to grow it further and improve it in quality.
* Educate the masses and the less familiar members with the ICON project and slowly on-board them through fact sharing.
* Engage different communities within the crypto sphere.
* Aim to spend a portion of the budget on outreach out of the crypto community to test this market space, help to understand potential to further optimize the campaign in the future.
