In order to protect ICON contributors from illegal parties, the ICON team has partnered with a Singapore based Fintech company, [Cynopsis Solutions](https://www.cynopsis-solutions.com/). Cynopsis Solutions is a KYC specialized company that provided KYC services for various blockchain projects.

After the KYC Application Submission close, the received KYC data is run through Cynopsis Solution’s Artemis AML (Anti-Money-Laundering) algorithm to ensure security, and the safe distribution of ICX. The AML filtering will take additional 2 weeks after KYC Submission Period to be fully processed. ***The expected KYC process completion(submission & review) is in late November***.

The ICON Team manages the security of the contributor’s private information with the highest priority at all times. Thank you for your continuous interest and support.
