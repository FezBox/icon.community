### ICON Lunar Holiday Greetings

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*01OcfMHCr5Hjb1nr7WntZA.jpeg)Dear ICON Supporters,

Kindly note that the Korea Operation Team Office will be closed for Korean Thanksgiving Day and Hangul Proclamation Day (Oct 2 ~ Oct 9, 2017). We will resume to normal office hours on Tuesday Oct. 10, 2017.

Korean Thanksgiving Day is one of the biggest/important holiday in Korea. Our ancestors would gather together with family and relatives to thank the prosperous outcome of this time after harvest. We follow the tradition to gather with our families and loved ones to celebrate a good year, and in hope to have a serene and safe winter.

Hangul Proclamation Day was established in 1926 to commemorate the day of Korean Alphabets’ creation.

Our hotline is always available via email and telegram. For emergency, please, feel free to contact Victoria at victoria@icon.foundation or hello@icon.foundation

Thank you all for your continuous support, and understanding.
