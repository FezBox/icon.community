## ICON Social Channel Aggregation

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*v-IUoANvuEFPHL986kF40A.png)## Migration from Slack toÂ Telegram

ICON is aggregating its channels. During the ICON Token Sale, there were numerous phishing attempts in the Slack chat room. Slack was never intended to become a public chat room. Which is why Slack was so vulnerable to scamming attempts.

In order to increase the security of the ICON chat room we are moving the chat room to Telegram. The ICON Telegram room will primarily be for discussion about the future of ICON, rather than a pure announcement channel.

The Slack chat room will be close down in a few days. Please join the new ICON Telegram chat room.
