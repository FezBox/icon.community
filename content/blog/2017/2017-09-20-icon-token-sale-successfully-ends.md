## ICON Token Sale Successfully Ends

### Token Sale Ended on Sept 20, 2017 / 19:33 (UTC+9)

### ICON Raises 150,000 ETH Total — 75,000 ETH from Public Pre-Sale in 6 Hours!

The ICON team would like to express our sincere appreciation to everyone who have supported the ICON Project. We want to share this moment with all our supporters.

Today’s Pre-Sale “Term 1” was specifically designed for smaller contributors, prior to the main Token Sale (Oct 20, 2017). However, due to an overwhelming interest from the blockchain community, the overall ICON Token Sale has ended earlier than expected.

The ICON Token Sale started on Sept 20, 2017 / 13:00 (UTC+9) and successfully ended on Sept 20, 2017 / 19:33 (UTC+9).

Overall ICON raised 150,000 ETH. 75,000 ETH was raised from “Strategic Contributors” and 75,000 ETH was raised from the Public Pre-Sale.

We would also like to thank our truly global strategic contributors including NextBlock Global (Canada), Blockchain Partners Korea (Korea), Blockchange Ventures (USA), CM Crypto Fund (Hong Kong), Coinsilium (UK), Cryptoparency (USA), Cryptobazar (Russia), Kenetic Capital (Hong Kong), Mindfund (Hong Kong), Pantera Capital (USA), TAAS (Singapore), and many others supporters of ICON’s vision.

Finally, special thanks to our amazing group of advisors — Don Tapscott, Eddy Travia, Ismail Malik, Jason Best, Jehan Chu, Paul Veradittakit, Simon Kim, and Yiseul Cho. We look forward to working with you.

Thank you all for joining ICON on this blockchain journey!
