## KYC Schedule Update

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*v-IUoANvuEFPHL986kF40A.png)With the recent tightening of blockchain regulations, ICON is preparing additional legal policies. In order to properly protect ICON contributors, the ICON KYC process will be delayed by a few weeks.

In particular, the ICON team is preparing a “Privacy Policy” and “updated Terms and Conditions” for contributors to safely submit their KYC information.

The KYC process will NOT start on the originally scheduled date Oct 2, 2017. The updated KYC schedule will be posted on the ICON blog and sent via newsletter.

As KYC deals with various personal data, the ICON website is being upgraded to include additional security measures. Therefore the website login is temporarily disabled. Thank you for your patience.
