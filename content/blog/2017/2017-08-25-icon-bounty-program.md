## ICON BountyÂ Program

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bfmRvaxhlOTQXK8C1aOZkg.png)ICON is launching a Bounty Program! Promote ICON and get ICX for Free! Instead of spending our funds for Facebook and Google Ads, we will benefit our ICON users directly. Participate in the Bounty Program now.

The purpose of the Bounty Program is to the promote the ICON ICO. The ICON ICO will raise $44M and become the largest ICO in Korea. The ICO starts on October 20, 2017 and ends on November 3, 2017.

The Bounty will be accounted and distributed after the ICO is over. A Bounty Application Form (Google Form) is mandatory for each and every Bounty submission. For example, when you make a retweet, each Retweet requires a separate Bounty Application Form submission.

You may check the current state of your Bounty application submission in the Tracker Sheet. Only applications submitted to the Bounty program will be reviewed for the Bounty bonus.

Leftover Bounty will be given to individuals with exceptional performance. So, please, put in extra effort to win the Community Reward!

**The ICON Bounty Campaign consists of 4 categories:**

1. Slack Join
