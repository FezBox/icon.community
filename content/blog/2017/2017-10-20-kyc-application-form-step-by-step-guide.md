Thank you for your interest in the ICON Project. This post will explain the background regarding the implementation of KYC(Know-Your-Customer) and the detailed KYC procedures.

ICON has implemented KYC in order to follow rapidly changing international regulations. By implementing KYC, the ICON project and participants will be protected from legal risks and provide a more stable development environment for the foundation, list ICX on cryptocurrency exchanges, and better enable community connections.

You MUST follow the KYC process to unlock your Pre-Sale ICX Tokens. The ICX Token refund process will begin, if you do NOT follow the KYC process or your KYC application is disqualified.

The ICON team will send out weekly KYC confirmation emails every Friday. Contributors who properly submitted KYC applications will get a “Confirmation” email. Contributors who have incorrectly submitted KYC applications will get a “Resubmission” email.

Just because a KYC form is submitted properly does not mean the contributor has passed the KYC process. The final KYC qualification/disqualification will be announced after the AML process is concluded in November.
