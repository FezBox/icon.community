## Token Sale “Term 1” Bonus Results

### ICX Bonus

The “Term 1” bonuses have been organized. Term 1 bonuses were selected based on the “Blockno” and “Txhash”. The first winner is the 10th contributor and the subsequent winners are 10+25nth Contributor (ie: 10, 35, 60, 85,…… , 1210, 1235th contributor).

The selected winners will get an additional 100% bonus of their contributed ETH. For example, If the winning participant contributed 10 ETH = 25,000 ICX, then the winning participant will get an additional bonus 25,000 ICX (10 ETH worth of ICX).

### ICX Airdrop

As the Token Sale, unexpectedly ended in Term 1, the Term 2 and Term 3 airdrops will be airdropped to **ALL** ICON Token Sale contributors.

We originally planned 1,500 ETH airdrops for Term 2 and Term 3, which is 2% of total contribution — 75,000 ETH. Therefore, all Token Sale contributors will get an additional 2% airdropped of their contributed ETH. The total amount of ICX airdropped is 3,750,000 ICX.

For example, if the winning participant contributed 10 ETH = 25,000 ICX, then the winning participant will get an additional 500 ICX airdrop (0.2 ETH worth of ICX).
