A crypto wallet serves as your on-chain identity and provides you with access to your cryptocurrencies and tokens. On ICON, a wallet lets you hold assets like ICX, IRC tokens, and NFTs, and also allows you to interact with ICON dApps like Balanced, Omm, and Craft. There are a variety of wallets that are compatible with the ICON blockchain including Hana, ICONex, MyIconWallet, and WalletX. In this article, you'll learn how to set up an ICON wallet with Hana, the most popular wallet in the ICON ecosystem.

## How to Download Hana

Hana is a Chrome extension wallet, which means it can be used on any desktop platform (macOS, Windows, and Linux) where Google Chrome can be installed. To download Hana, navigate to the [official Hana listing](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hana/jfdlamikmbghhapbgfoogdffldioobgl) on the Chrome web store, and click "Add to Chrome".

After installing the Chrome extension, you should see the Hana logo in your menu bar. If you don't see it, click on the extensions icon, and click the pin icon to pin Hana to your menu bar.

## How to Create a New Wallet in Hana

To create a new wallet, click on the Hana extension and select "Create a new account".

{{< img src="hana-create-icon-wallet.jpg" alt="Create a new ICON wallet in Hana." caption="Create a new ICON wallet in Hana." >}}

Next, specify a password for your Hana wallet. This password will be responsible for securing all your assets, so be sure to choose a secure password complete with alphanumeric characters and symbols. If you're unsure whether your password is secure, we recommend using a strong password generator like [this one](https://www.strongpasswordgenerator.org/).

{{< img src="create-hana-password.jpg" alt="Specify a password for your Hana wallet." caption="Specify a password for your Hana wallet." >}}

After creating a password, you'll be prompted to back up your 12-word seed phrase – a sequence of words that can be used to cryptographically restore your wallet in the future. **Do not proceed to the next step without backing up your seed phrase, and never share your seed phrase with anyone.** Furthermore, do not store your seed phrase online in your email inbox or a storage provider like DropBox or Google Drive. Instead, it's best to stick to offline storage by writing down your seed phrase on a piece of paper or using a dedicated backup product like the [Billfodl](https://privacypros.io/products/the-billfodl) from Privacy Pros.

{{< img src="hana-12-word-seed-phrase.jpg" alt="Back up your 12-word seed phrase." caption="Back up your 12-word seed phrase." >}}

Next, you'll be prompted to confirm your seed phrase. If you did not follow the instructions above and back up your seed phrase, click the back button to view your seed phrase again.

{{< img src="hana-confirm-seed-phrase.jpg" alt="Confirm your seed phrase in Hana." caption="Confirm your seed phrase in Hana." >}}

After confirming your seed phrase, Hana will prompt you to select which chains you want to interact with. Since Hana is a multi-chain wallet, it supports a variety of blockchains beyond ICON like Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Polkadot, and Moonbeam. For the purposes of this article, we'll only be setting up an ICON wallet, so just select ICON for the time being.

After clicking through the remaining prompts, you'll be greeted with your new Hana wallet.

## A Quick Overview of Hana

In addition to the main body of Hana's user interface, it also has two menu bars – one in the header and one in the footer.

{{< img src="hana-wallet-created.jpg" alt="The Hana user interface." caption="The Hana user interface." >}}

### Hana Header Menu Bar

The header menu bar is the blue section at the top of the wallet interface, and contains a hamburger menu icon to the right hand side. Clicking on the menu icon triggers the "My wallets" side menu, which is where you can select which wallet you want to interact with. The "My wallets" menu is also where you can add change from mainnet to a testnet network, add a new wallet, and lock your wallet.

### Hana Footer Menu Bar

The footer menu bar is split into five sections designated with icons – home, trade, earn, transactions, and settings.

{{< img src="hana-footer-menu-bar.jpg" alt="Home, trade, earn, transactions, and settings in Hana." caption="Home, trade, earn, transactions, and settings in Hana." >}}

* The "Home" section displays the value of your portfolio in USD, as well as a list of your crypto assets and tokens. In the future, Hana will also display NFTs held in your wallet.
* The "Trade" section is where you can send and receive crypto assets.
* The "Earn" section provides an interface for staking and delegating ICX to validators.
* The "Transactions" section displays the transaction history for your wallet.
* The "Settings" section is where you can change various settings in Hana.

## How to Find Your ICX Address (Public Key) in Hana

To receive funds, you'll need to provide the sender with the ICX address or public key associated with your ICON wallet. In Hana, your ICX address can be found by clicking on the name of your wallet ("Wallet 1" in the screenshot below).

Your ICX address (starts with "hx") can be found in the pop-up modal.

Sending ICX and IRC-20 tokens with Hana is quick and easy. To get started, click on the "Trade" section in the footer menu bar and select "Send".

Next, click on the asset you want to send. Hana supports both ICX and IRC-20 tokens (BALN, OMM, CFT, etc.). In the screenshot below, the wallet has 10 ICX and 50 CFT.

## How to Use Hana With a Ledger Wallet

The [Ledger Nano](https://www.ledger.com) line of hardware wallets are extremely popular among ICX holders and beyond. Hana has built-in support for Ledger wallets, which makes it super easy to use your hardware wallet to send ICX transactions and use ICON dApps.

To add a Ledger wallet to Hana, click the hamburger icon in the top right corner of Hana, click "Add a wallet", and select "Restore a wallet". 

{{< img src="hana-restore-a-wallet.jpg" alt="Restore a wallet in Hana." caption="Restore a wallet in Hana." >}}

Next, select the "Connect with your Ledger" option.

{{< img src="hana-connect-with-ledger.jpg" alt="Connect with your Ledger wallet." caption="Connect with your Ledger wallet." >}}

Something which you may not know is that Ledger wallets come with support for multiple accounts. To import a wallet into Hana, you'll need to select a Ledger account. We recommend sticking with the first account on the first page. If you need additional wallets linked to another account on your Ledger, you can always add another wallet later on.

{{< img src="hana-select-ledger-account.jpg" alt="Select a Ledger account to import." caption="Select a Ledger account to import." >}}

After importing the wallet, your new Ledger account will be listed under "My wallets".
