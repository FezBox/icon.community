By the end of 2022, exactly one year after the succesful Java SCORE activation, support for running Python SCORE will come to an end. This includes the removal of the `iconee` source code from the `goloop` repository completely.

We encourage all DApp owners to migrate their dApp to Java by the end of this year (2022). However, practically, dApp owners should migrate their dApp to Java as soon as possible. Please note: The more Python code you add, the more difficult it becomes to migrate to Java.

Further, weâ€™d like to emphasize that the current audit process for the existing Python SCORE is actually not meant for big upgrades, rather it is meant for small maintenance updates to earn time until the later Java migration.
