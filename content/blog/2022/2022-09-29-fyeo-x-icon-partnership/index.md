ICON has partnered with [FYEO](http://gofyeo.com) to perform a security audit for the soon to launch ICON Bridge. Auditing is a crucial step for any major project release and FYEO brings a world class security team to test the ICON Bridge codebase. 

FYEO’s code audit team is composed of some of the best DeFi logic experts in the world with experience on protocols like Solana, NEAR, Ethereum and Algorand. Its flagship products, FYEO Domain Intelligence, and FYEO Identity were developed to provide unparalleled security and address present-day security issues impacting both organizations and individuals. 

This audit marks a major step in establishing ICON’s footprint as a leader in the interoperability space. ICON Bridge is the first “trusted” iteration of BTP that allows users to bridge assets between members of the “BTP Network”. Starting with a bridge between ICON and Binance Smart Chain, integrations with NEAR, Harmony, Moonbeam, and Ethereum will soon follow.

FYEO will perform a code review for CMD/GO, Java and Solidity. The initial code review is expected to conclude at the end of October 2022. After which there will be a remediation period for code fixes, a re-review period and final report. 

The audit processes provides ICON:
* A better understanding of its security posture and helps them identify current and future risks in its deployed chain & contract infrastructure.
* An opinion on what security measures are in place regarding maturity, adequacy, and efficiency.
* Potential issues, including loss of funds scenarios, and include improvement recommendations based on the result of our assessment.
* A better understanding of writing and maintaining more secure code. The incremental increase of security is part of the overall increased quality of the project.

## FYEO’s  Interactive Approach 
FYEO is not a drive-thru audit shop. A FYEO Audit is an interactive experience  that delivers updates in real-time throughout the duration of their  line-by-line auditing process. This allows teams to learn from common mistakes made early on and prevent future exploits - saving time, money and reputational risk.
