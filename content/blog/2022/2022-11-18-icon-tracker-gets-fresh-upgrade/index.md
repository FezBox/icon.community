The ICON Tracker will be redirected from tracker.icon.foundation to tracker.icon.community on December 5th 8:00 PM ET and the tracker.icon.foundation will be completely shut down by January 5th 10:00 AM ET. 

Please make appropriate adjustments so that you are not affected by the redirect and shutdown of the old tracker. 

## Tracker improvements
The new tracker is being built by [sudoblock](https://tracker.icon.community/address/hxfc56203484921c3b7a4dee9579d8614d8c8daaf5) (previously known as Geometry Labs) and has thus far been funded through a mixture of [foundation grants](https://build.icon.foundation/grants) and [CPS](https://cps.icon.community/). 

It has improved on the old tracker in the following ways to better support cross chain user experience on ICON: 

* A custom ETL pipeline and Go-based API implementation for better API performance. 
* [Well-documented and publicly accessible API endpoints](https://tracker.icon.community/api/v1/docs/index.html) that follow the OpenAPI specification.
* [Open source documentation](https://github.com/sudoblockio/icon-tracker) that allows community members to directly add/improve functionality.  

These improvements have already encouraged other projects in the ICON ecosystem to build on the APIs, resulting in several collaborations across the community. 

## Moving forward
The ICON Tracker is an example of a product for which community members are the key stakeholders. It was built for the community, by the community.

Once the tracker is considered feature-complete, it will move into a maintenance phase. This means that the code base will not be expanded upon, except for minor changes or bug fixes. From here on out, maintenance fees or further development (beyond items marked in this [roadmap](https://github.com/sudoblockio/icon-tracker/tree/main/planning)) will be funded via CPS. 

For any troubleshooting support, please join the #dev_support channel on [ICON Discord](https://discord.gg/qwsknc4utD). To report bugs or to make product related suggestions, you can [submit a request](https://icon.community/blog/2022/how-to-submit-an-issue-on-github/) directly through the [Tracker GitHub](https://github.com/sudoblockio/icon-tracker).
