As a blockchain focused on interoperability, one of our core missions is to build sustainable and engaging cross-chain communities. We envision a world where users from diverse backgrounds can come together and contribute to the future of blockchain, crypto, and Web3. To help us achieve this goal, we’ve expanded the scope of ICON’s Discord to the entire BTP ecosystem, which consists of ICON, Polkadot, Kusama, Harmony, Binance Smart Chain, NEAR Protocol, and more.

As part of our strategy to build a dynamic community, we’ve designed an address registration bot which lets users submit wallet addresses for supported networks. From time to time, registered users will be able to participate in special events such as giveaways, quizzes, NFT mints, and more. While registering your address(es) is not required to become a full-fledged member of the ICON Discord, we highly recommend doing so to maximize the value of your Discord membership.

## Supported Networks

The mICON Discord Bot currently supports the following networks for address registration:

* ICON
* Polkadot
* Harmony

To register an address, you’ll first need to enable DMs in Discord. To do so, go to **Preferences > Privacy & Safety**. In the section titled “Server Privacy Defaults”, enable “Allow direct messages from server members”.

Next, start a DM conversation with the mICON bot (mICON#9635) and use the `/register-address` slash command. If you’ve never used a slash command, all you need to do is start typing `/register-address` and you’ll see the slash command menu pop up like so:

The `/register-address` command has two parameters – network and address. To navigate between the two parameters, you can use your space bar, tab key, or left/right arrow keys.

Follow the instructions below to learn how to register a wallet address for each supported network.

### How to Register an ICON (ICX) Address

After typing `/register-address`, type `icon` for the “network” and a valid ICX address for the “address”.

Note: We only support Harmony (ONE) addresses in Ethereum format (starts with “0x”).

## Summary

After registering your address, you should receive a success message followed by a few messages that indicate the `ICON MEMBER` role has been assigned to your Discord user profile. If you do not receive these messages, please reach out to a moderator for further assistance.

Once your address has been successfully registered, you’ll automatically be eligible for future giveaways, quizzes, and other special events. In the meantime, why not take a look around the Discord and get involved in some discussions with your fellow community members?
