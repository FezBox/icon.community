## A Demographic Breakdown of ICON Contributors and Communities

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*qLGjn-iAC0UD-YqsoBVNJg.png)Greetings from the ICON Team,

Hundreds and thousands of reactions were followed by our last [announcement](https://medium.com/helloiconworld/icon-annual-summit-mainnet-launch-release-candidate-6a6c5b5d86da) on Mainnet launch and ICON Annual Summit. Thanks again for everyone’s interest and support to the ICON Project.

Here we are unveiling some figures behind the token sale to give a glimpse into the contributors of the ICON community.

South Korea is our largest constituent group by nationality and accounts for 15% of the entire pool. Europe, our second largest constituent by region at 45%, is further broken down into +40 different nationalities. Supporters from the Americas, Oceania, and Africa collectively make up 19% of the entire participant pool.

ICON team has planned more trips abroad in 2018 to meet our supporters and foster local communities. We look forward to meeting you and expanding our global presence this year.

We would like to once again thank everyone for making ICON a truly global effort.

Thank you,

Hyperconnect the World  
ICON Team
