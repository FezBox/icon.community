## **The Token Swap has Ended**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*19E8GlvhXpryV8-L)Greetings from the ICON Team,

**The official token swap for the ERC20 ICX Token has closed at the final swap rate of approximately 96% on October 25 at 13:00 (KST).**

The exchanges that supported token swap are **Binance, Upbit, OKEx, DragonEx, Bithumb, Huobi, Bitrue, Gate.io, and WazirX**. The ERC20 ICX Tokens stored in these nine exchanges were automatically swapped to Mainnet ICX.

Also, the swap requested before October 25th 13:00 (KST) will be included for the swap, and ERC20 tokens that were swapped will be locked up. The remaining ERC20 tokens will be locked as well, preventing future transfers.

Unswapped Mainnet ICX will be held in a reserve only for individuals or exchanges that had unavoidable circumstances prevent them from executing the token swap on time. For those that believe they fall into this category, please reach out to support@icon.foundation

Thank you for your patience and support during the token swap. ICON is now looking to the future as we continue to strive towards a Hyperconnected world.

## ***Note**

- Please be careful with fraud attempts using the unswapped ERC20 ICX Token. For example, check to make sure the proposed ICX transaction uses an address that starts with “hx”, NOT “0x”. The ICON Team is not responsible for individual’s property damage caused by transactions of ERC20 ICX Tokens. Please report any fraud attempts to [support@icon.foundation](http://support@icon.foundation)

-Token swap submitted on October 25, 2018 (KST) will be completed on October 26, 2018 (KST) due to ICONex Google Chrome extension and iOS updates, etc.

For any further inquiries regarding the token swap, please contact us at [support@icon.foundation](http://support@icon.foundation)

Thank you,

Hyperconnect the World
