### Airdrop details sent via email

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_83yRvRgaoNGYUx81LGI5g.png)Greetings from the ICON team.

The detailed schedule and information has been sent to those who are subject to the Airdrop today.

We have used a survey company to collect information needed and the sender email is from “hello@icon.foundation via research.net”

Sorry for the confusion caused from the sender email address.

The survey should look as follows;

> *** CAUTION**


> ICON team **NEVER** asks for individual private keys or ICX.


> If you have not received the mail on March 2nd even though you are subject to the airdrop, please check your spam mail folder or other mail inboxes such as promotion tabs, etc. If you still have not received the mail, please leave your information on<https://goo.gl/forms/ZBhQlenVDxdu5J4I3>.

Once again, we are sorry for the confusion caused.

Thank you.
