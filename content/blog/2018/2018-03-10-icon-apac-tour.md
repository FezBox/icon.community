### DApp Teams

**Tink**

Personal background information is often asked when starting a new personal and business relationship. However, it takes more than background information to understand each other and establish a trust-based relationship. User profiles in social media today are not verified, which makes it difficult to establish trust-based relationships with profile information alone. Any good relationship is built on trust for each other but it costs too much time and effort to earn trust from others.

Tink is a decentralized social platform that creates credible personal information through social verification and a complete profile with qualitative information of the user. Tink’s profile based network helps users to build a strong and trustworthy human network and opens new opportunities in relationships, employment, and finance.

**Sentinel Protocol**

Sentinel Protocol is a Security Intelligence Platform for Blockchain (SIPB) to protect valuable crypto assets against hacking, scams and frauds. Sentinel Protocol leverages the blockchain technology to optimize system availability and integrity while also utilizes the consensus and incentive scheme to share collective security intelligence. Its decentralized Threat Reputation Database (TRDB) is provided on public blockchain for crypto exchanges, payments and wallet services so that the value of stolen currencies can be incapacitated. Sentinel Protocol operates based on collective intelligence of cybersecurity specialists, as well as preventive security measures such as machine learning for behavior modeling and cost-effective distributed sandboxing.
