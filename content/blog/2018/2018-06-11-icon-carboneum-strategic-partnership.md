### ICON — Carboneum, strategic partnership

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*2G3-DNunBrqBHOOf)Greetings from the ICON Team

ICON and [Carboneum](https://www.carboneum.io/) signed a strategic partnership to proactively help Carboneum with its technical development on ICON blockchain and strategically support the project’s further expansion.

Carboneum is a decentralized infrastructure and protocol for social trading, leveraging blockchain to promote transparency, automation and a fair fee mechanism, which are missing in social trading systems today.

Carboneum is backed by Thailand’s leading online stock trading and analytical platform, [StockRadars](https://stockradars.co/info/), which is a revenue-generating social trading app with over 680K downloads and a joint service with LINE with over 4.8M users.

The strategic partnership with Carboneum will not only help expand ICON’s network but also help bring great services to be used in the real life world.
