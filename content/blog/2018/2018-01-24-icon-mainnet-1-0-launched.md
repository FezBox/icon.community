We are happy to announce that the maintenance check of our testnet, which started last December, has been completed, and today, **January 24th, 2018 (18:25 UTC), we have successfully generated the Genesis Block of the ICON Mainnet** andminted all ICX as planned. Thank you for your patience and support!

The mainnet launch is a giant step towards achieving our vision — *Hyperconnect the World*. Clearly, this is exciting news for our team and community. However, we want to remind you that this is only the beginning, there is a lot more works to be done, and subsequent announcements will follow. The ICON Team will continue to perform tests and monitor the network until the official opening of ICON Mainnet for ICX Wallet release.

DApps can now be developed on top of the ICON network and our team is already helping several DApp teams to launch new services. Although we are eager to showcase these projects today, the community needs to wait a bit longer. We will open the details on January 31st at the *ICON Annual Summit: The Genesis*. Although we can’t invite each and every one of our supporters to the event, we are planning to livestream and publish the details on our blog and newsletter.

In the meantime, we would like to address some of the top questions below.
