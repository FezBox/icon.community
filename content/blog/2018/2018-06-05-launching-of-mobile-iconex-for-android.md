## **Launching of Mobile ICONex for Android**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*5YdxvBhj-vml0GO9)Greetings from the ICON Team,

The mobile version of ICONex for Android is now officially open. You can download the Android version of ICONex through Google Play.

You can store and manage your ICX and ETH just as you do on the chrome extension wallet. The mobile version of ICONex will make it easier for you to access your wallet whenever and wherever you are as long as you have your mobile phone.

We apologize to those using iOS, as it will take some more time for the mobile version of ICONex for iOS to be launched. We don’t have an exact date for the iOS release, but we are doing our best to speed up the process. The launch of ICONex for iOS will be announced as soon as the date is finalized.
