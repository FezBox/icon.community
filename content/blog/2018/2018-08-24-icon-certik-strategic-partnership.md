### ICON-CertiK, Strategic partnership

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dtUYMS09391pM2YBk2gNQg.png)Greetings from the ICON Team,

Before blockchain can reach mass adoption, a blockchain and its respective components must meet high security standards. With this thought in mind, we are excited to announce a strategic partnership between the ICON Foundation and [CertiK](https://certik.org/), a smart contract auditing firm with a patented technique to automate formal verification of smart contracts.

This partnership will lead to a more secure ICON Ecosystem, as DApp projects launching on ICON will soon have the ability to submit their SCOREs to CertiK for an almost entirely automated smart contract audit.

With the recent announcement of [ICX Station](https://www.icxstation.com/), we expect DApp projects coming through the accelerator program to see significant benefits from this partnership. Ronghui Gu, Co-Founder of CertiK, is joining ICX Station as an advisor, and CertiK will be providing auditing services for everything from token sale contracts to more complex smart contracts that secure the back-end of a DApp.

Thank you,

Hyperconnect the World  
ICON Team
