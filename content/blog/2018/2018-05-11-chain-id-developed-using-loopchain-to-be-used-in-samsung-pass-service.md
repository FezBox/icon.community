On May 11th Korea Financial Investment Association(KOFIA), which theloop is participating as a technical partner to develop CHAIN ID, has signed an MOU with Samsung Electronics to incorporate CHAIN ID in Samsung’s ‘Samsung Pass’ service.

CHAIN ID is the world’s first blockchain based joint authentication system developed using theloop’s blockchain engine ‘loopchain’, and is being used by 11 securities companies in Korea.

We believe that this MOU with a leading global conglomerate is a big step towards both real-world adoption and globalization of blockchain technology.

We are proud to say that loopchain is at the core of CHAIN ID and honored to be recognized by a corporation as reputable as Samsung.
