We are happy to announce that ICON’s official wallet ICONex (web, Android, iOS) has completed an external vulnerability analysis, action and implementation check from [NSHC](https://www.nshc.net/wp/), one of the top financial security consulting firm in South Korea. We have complied all the security standards of NSHC and received their certificate of information security.
