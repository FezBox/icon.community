### **ICON-Portal Network, Strategic Partnership**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*iH7S8zk84j5jF3u0)Greetings from the ICON Team,

September 5th, 2018 — The ICON Foundation and [Portal Network](https://www.portal.network/) announced a strategic partnership agreement to build [**ICONick**](http://iconick.portal.network) **(ICON Name Service), the domain name service on top of the ICON blockchain**. ICONick is governed by smart contracts that transform human-comprehensible decentralized website names, such as ‘yourwebsite.icon’, into addresses that can be understood by decentralized network machines.

Portal Network has been building Blockchain Name Service (BNS) standards governed by smart contracts in an effort to simplify the user experience on all smart contract supported chains. The ICON Foundation will work closely with Portal Network on building features for ICONick along with product suites including a [Marketplace](https://market.portal.network), [browser extension](https://extension.portal.network), and [more](https://mumei.portal.network).

The ICON Foundation is excited to collaborate on ICONick with Portal Network to enhance the user experience of the ICON platform by replacing complex wallet addresses with human-comprehensible names and allow both technical and non-technical users to easily deploy and use blockchain-related services. We believe that by implementing ICONick with the ICON platform, everyone within the ICON network will be able to easily interact with IPFS hashes, smart contracts, and wallet address, all of which enhance the growth of the ICON ecosystem.

Thank you,

Hyperconnect the world  
ICON Team
