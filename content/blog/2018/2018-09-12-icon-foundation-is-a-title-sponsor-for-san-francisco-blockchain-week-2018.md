Greetings from the ICON Team,

The ICON Foundation is proud to announce that we are a **title sponsor for ‘San Francisco Blockchain Week’** taking place in San Francisco, CA from October 8th to the 11th.

San Francisco Blockchain Week is a week of educational, consumer, and developer focused events that **aim to push the boundaries of local blockchain innovation** which has been welcomed by the San Francisco community. The goal of this week-long, immersive experience is to help the industry reach mainstream adoption through fundamental education and development of projects that matter.

The timing of the event perfectly coincides with major recent / upcoming ICON milestones such as the mainnet update, open source release, ICON Developers Portal, and ICX Station launch — all of which support ICON’s development community.

The agenda will include a keynote speech from **ICON Foundation’s council member Min Kim, an ICON developers’ bootcamp, and a surprise event** for attendees.
