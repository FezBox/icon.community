## ICON Foundation Runs Bug Bounty Program

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*e0tpNgWI6-PLGXc7vNoVlg.png)Greetings from the ICON Team,

The ICON Foundation is pleased to announce a bug bounty program with [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/), a leading bug bounty platform with more than 100,000 registered hackers to improve the security of the ICON Network. A ‘Bug Bounty’ provides rewards to external researchers (white-hat hackers) who find vulnerabilities in software and expose them to the companies. The ICON Foundation is working on this program to detect vulnerabilities in the ICON Project and quickly apply security patches to build effective and reliable blockchain platforms.

HackerOne is a global cybersecurity company with numerous bug bounty practices, from a large number of big companies across diverse industries to the Pentagon. The world’s leading companies, including Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Starbucks, GM, and others, have used HackerOne’s bug bounty platform, and HackerOne has been recognized for trusted relationships with white-hat hackers and for the excellence of their platform.

In this program, many global hackers will join to check and report the vulnerabilities and bugs in ICON networks. The ICON Foundation will address the issues and strengthen the stability and security of the blockchain system through this program.

In the future, the ICON Foundation will continue to make efforts to improve security to build a more secure blockchain network.

Thank you,

Hyperconnect the World  
ICON Team
