## **Join ICON at San Francisco Blockchain Week 2018 (Full Schedule)**

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*6tQ3zJV5v_7T1sIaE9aCzg.jpeg)Greetings from the ICON Team,

The ICON Foundation would like to remind the community that **we are a title sponsor for** [**San Francisco Blockchain Week**](https://sfblockchainweek.io/) **taking place in San Francisco, California starting this coming Monday, October 8th.**

All, come listen to ICON Foundation council member Min Kim’s keynote speech titled *‘Blockchain Evolution: A Transition to a Hyperconnected World’* where he will share his views on where the blockchain industry is heading and how the ICON project is contributing to the overall movement.

Developers, *‘Come SCORE on ICON!’* During our developers workshop, learn how to build your own DApp on ICON through a hands-on session. 50 exclusive ICON x SF Blockchain Week backpacks will be given out to those who build a DApp at the end of the session.

We are excited to announce that the ICON Foundation is the exclusive sponsor of the CESC Reception taking place on the evening of the 10th. Also, be sure to check out the panel appearances by the [ICX Station](http://icxstation.com) team (Daeki Lee and Scott Smiley) in the full schedule below.
